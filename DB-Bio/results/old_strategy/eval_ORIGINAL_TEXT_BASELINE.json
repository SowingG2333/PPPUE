Staying at Cambridge as a fellow of Emmanuel College he completed his doctorate following work on soil deformation models. It was here that he met and married Elizabeth Gorham with whom he would have three daughters and a son. Hambly left academia to spend five years working with Ove Arup and Partners in the design of structures and Gifford and Partners in bridge building. He devised new models and work methods for the approximation of structural behaviour which he published in 1976 in his first book, Bridge Deck Behaviour. In 1974 he set up his own consultancy and worked from his home in Hertfordshire, writing more than 40 technical papers to supplement his income. One of his first contracts was to investigate the design of bridge foundations for the Building Research Establishment, publishing some of his findings in Bridge Foundations and Substructures in 1979. He was asked by the oil and gas extraction industries to advise upon offshore platforms damaged by wave fatigue and collisions. His expertise in the industry was widely recognized and he was created a fellow of the Institution of Structural Engineers in 1982, of the Royal Academy of Engineering in 1984 and of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers in 1991. He also served as chairman of the Offshore Engineering Society between 1989 and 1990. He worked as a visiting professor at Oxford University from 1989 to 1992 lecturing in structural analysis, he wrote his third book, Structural Analysis by Example (1994) to provide examples of calculations for students.

Listed at 5' 4\\\", 130 lb., she batted and threw right-handed. A native of Chicago, Illinois, Jo Lenard grew up playing baseball with her brother and the other boys in the streets of her neighborhood. Playground ball was the next step, then into the high school league and on to a Chicago amateur girls softball team. Lenard was in school when she learned that there was a nationwide effort to recruit women to play in a new Midwest professional softball/baseball league. By the fall of 1942, many Minor league teams disbanded due to World War II conflict, when young ballplayers were being drafted into the armed services. The fear that this pattern would continue prompted Philip K. Wrigley, a chewing gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team, to search for a possible solution to this dilemma. When President Roosevelt gave the order to continue baseball for the morale of the nation, Wrigley decided that it was time to do it. With the dedication of a group of Midwestern businessmen, and the financial support of Wrigley, the new league emerged in the spring of 1943. Lenard attended a AAGPBL tryout and made the grade, starting a professional career that spanned ten years. A consistent line-drive hitter who used the entire field and excelled at slap bunting for base hits, she was a skillful contact hitter with a near perfect eye for the strike zone and seldom struck out. By the time her AAGPBL career ended in 1953, Lenard had driven in 351 runs to place her ninth on the career RBI list for the league, despite hitting only one home run in just over 3400 at bats. She also collected 520 stolen bases and walked 481 times against only 234 strikeouts for a 2.06 BB/K ratio. A natural center fielder, she possessed a strong and accurate throwing arm. Lenard entered the league in 1944 with the Rockford Peaches, playing for them two years before joining the Muskegon Lassies (1946-'49), Peoria Redwings (1949), Kenosha Comets (1950-'51) and South Bend Blue Sox (1952-'53). In her rookie season, she hit a .211 average and stole 68 bases, while leading the circuit with 10 triples. Her most productive season came in 1947, when she hit a career-high .261 with 38 RBI in 111 games and was selected for the All-Star team. She also made four trips to the playoffs with four different teams, including for the championship winners in 1945 and 1952. Following her professional baseball career, Lenard went back to school and graduated from Chicago Teachers College, and then taught health and physical education for 25 years. Besides becoming an educator and coach, she was a strong advocate for the advancement of girls and women in sports. In 1968 she was assaulted and hit in the head, suffering eye damage that left her nearly blind. Lenard is part of the AAGPBL permanent display at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum at Cooperstown, New York, opened in 1988, which is dedicated to the entire league rather than any individual player. Jo Lenard died in her hometown of Chicago, Illinois, at the age of 85.",

After he and graduated from the Technical College in Taganrog (today the \\\"Taganrog Petlyakov Aviation College\\\", ru:Таганрогский авиационный колледж им. В. М. Петлякова) in 1910. he travelled to Moscow, where he was accepted into the Moscow State Technical University; however, due to financial difficulties he was unable to complete his studies. After the Russian Revolution, he continued his education and was hired to work as a technician in the aerodynamics laboratory at Moscow State Technical University under the guidance of Nikolai Zhukovsky, while resuming his studies. He gained experience as a laboratory assistant on wind tunnels and calculations for aircraft design. In 1922, he graduated from the same university. In 1921–1936, Petlyakov worked at the Central Aerohydrodynamic Institute under the guidance of Andrei Tupolev, where he was involved in wing design and the development of gliders. In 1936, he became a chief aircraft designer at an aviation plant. Petlyakov was directly involved in organization and development of Soviet metal aircraft construction. In particular, Petlyakov (together with an engineer Nikolai Belyaev) elaborated methods of calculating durability of materials and theory on designing metal wings with multiple spars. Petlyakov assisted in designing the first Soviet heavy bombers TB-1, TB-3 (1930–1935), and a long-range high-altitude four-engine bomber, the Pe-8 (1935–1937). However, on October 21, 1937, Petlyakov was arrested together with Tupolev and the entire directorate of the TsAGI on trumped up charges of sabotage, espionage and of aiding the Russian Fascist Party. Many of his colleagues were executed. In 1939, he was moved from a prison to an NKVD sharashka for aircraft designers near Moscow, where many ex-TsAGI people had already been sent to work. Petlyakov was tasked with designing a high-altitude fighter, which he successfully accomplished. However, operational experience in the Soviet-Finnish War showed that this was not what the Soviet Air Force needed, and Lavrentiy Beria, head of the NKVD and of the sharashka told that the fighter was to be redesigned as a dive bomber, with the promise that he and his colleagues would be released on its successful completion. The resulting aircraft, the Pe-2, which went into serial production at the Kazan Aviation Plant, proved to be one of the most successful designs of World War II. Petlyakov was released in 1940, and was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1941. However, at Kazan, Petlyakov faced increasing difficulties, with so many of his trained technicians and machinists conscripted into the Soviet military and sent to the front lines, which adversely affected the quality of production aircraft. He protested to Soviet senior leadership, and was on his way to Moscow in January 1942 (flying in a Pe-2), when he died in an air crash near Arzamas. His grave is at the Arskoe Cemetery in Kazan.

Listed at 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m), 165 lb., Hamrick batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Nashville, Tennessee. Fast and steady, Hamrick was one of many ballplayers who interrupted their careers to serve during World War II. Hamrick started his professional baseball career as a shortstop and pitcher in 1939, playing for the Nashville, Charleston and Americus Minor league teams. During his stay at Americus, he made the All-Star team in 1941 and batted over a .300 batting average for most of the year. His most productive season came in 1943, when he hit 145 in 460 at-bats with Nashville for a .310 average. Hamrick joined the Philadelphia Phillies in 1943. The following season, he began spring training with the team in Wilmington, Delaware, because the war kept the teams out of Florida for camp due to the submarine threat. Hamrick left spring training as Philadelphia’s starting shortstop, but he left for the military service after appearing in 74 games. With the end of the war, Hamrick rejoined the team (by then the Phillies) in 1946, but the competition for a roster spot was now overwhelming as Skeeter Newsome became the everyday shortstop. In a two-season majors career, Hamrick was a .204 hitter (92-for-452) in 118 games, including 34 runs, 32 RBI, 13 doubles, two triples, one home run and one stolen base. He made 74 appearances at shortstop (86) and second base (31), and posted a collective .946 fielding percentage. After that, Hamrick hit .266 (92-for-346) for the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League in 1946, his last professional baseball season.

As a child, he drew inspiration from the 1978 World Cup team who became the first African nation to win a World Cup match. At the age of 10, he joined his first club, Club Africain of Tunis, and he stayed there for the next 14 years, picking up two Tunisian league titles and one Tunisia Cup along the way. His quick pace, strength on the ball and creativity earned him a call-up to the national team, and he earned his first cap in September 1993, during a match against Germany. Following a promising performance he carved out a virtually permanent place for himself in the country's national team for the next eleven years. Tunisians grew to appreciate his discretion in life outside football as a modest and determined professional. On the pitch, he singularly distinguished himself at international level during the 1996 African Cup of Nations finals in South Africa as one of the best players of the tournament. Sellimi became a household name throughout the country, a skillful and talented bright spark who carried the team to the final of the tournament for the second time in their history. Sellimi struck twice in the semi-final against Zambia, and was widely considered one of the best players in the tournament. This movement into the limelight earned the player a transfer to French Ligue 1 side FC Nantes Atlantique, following another impressive showing at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. But his move to France marked the start of a long barren period. Although the Nantes fans dubbed him \\\"The Lung\\\" on account of the distance he clocked up during matches, he never really settled in at his new club. He hit just two goals in 30 appearances in his first season, and failed to achieve the kind of success he had enjoyed back home in Tunisia. After another disappointing season in 1997/98, Sellimi left Nantes for Spanish second division side Real Jaén. It was here that he got some first-class matches, and finally found form. This surge in form earned him a call-up to the 1998 World Cup squad, where he put in steady performances against England and Romania. Bundesliga side Freiburg took a gamble on Sellimi and partnered the player with other Tunisian internationals, anchorman Zoubeir Baya and fellow striker Mehdi Benslimane. But here too he took a long time finding his true form, and many at Freiburg considered him a mistaken purchase during his first year. However, he proved his detractors wrong in the best possible way in the 1999/2000 season. Sellimi just could not stop scoring goals and even headed the Bundesliga's goalscoring list going into the winter break. A disappointing 2001 lead to Sellimi missing out on the 2002 African Cup of Nations in Mali and a number of international friendlies after a fall-out with former national coach Henri Michel. But the Frenchman's replacement with Ammar Souayah coupled with the national team's goal drought brought about his recall. The 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan turned out to be Adel Sellimi's swansong in premier football competitions, and he retired from international football shortly after the tournament at the age of 31. He returned to Club Africain shortly afterwards, and is now Head Coach of Jendouba Sport in Tunisia, recently gaining promotion to Ligue 1.",

His career began in 1963, when he joined the Foreign Service as a clerical officer. Two years into his career, he was posted to the British embassy in Bonn, West Germany, and two years after that to Nigeria. From 1970 to 1972, Penfold served as a \\\"floater\\\" in Latin America, filling in as necessary for staff at British missions in the region. He served in Mexico during the 1970 football world cup, and on St Vincent, where he was responsible for organising an evacuation after a volcanic eruption. After Latin America, Penfold briefly served in Canberra, before returning to London to take a post in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). He earned early promotion to second secretary in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he was responsible for reporting on the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Eritrean War of Independence and was still in the country during the revolution, in which the pro-Western emperor was overthrown. After completing his tour in Ethiopia, Penfold served as information officer in Port of Spain and then as first secretary in the West Africa Department of the FCO. Penfold's next overseas posting was to Kampala, Uganda, as deputy high commissioner. There, he persuaded President Milton Obote to attend the queen's birthday party for the first time. Two months later, Obote was overthrown in a coup, after which Penfold led an evacuation of foreign citizens to Kenya. The high commission remained open, and Penfold was still present six months later when a second coup took place. In 1987, he again returned to the FCO, this time serving in the West Indian and Atlantic Department, and four years later, he was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands. The main issues of Penfold's tenure were the establishment of the territory as an offshore financial centre and the smuggling of drugs through its waters until the sudden death of the chief minister. Penfold resolved the subsequent constitutional crisis by appointing the deputy chief minister as an interim replacement. Penfold's term as governor expired in 1996, after which he spent a year as a drugs adviser to the Caribbean before being appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone in 1997. Six weeks into Penfold's term, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup and Penfold organised an evacuation of foreign citizens. After a hotel housing the remaining foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which was conducted by an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but the role of the private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent the last year of his career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO. His support of Kabbah, and his role in returning him to power in 1998, earned Penfold folk hero status in Sierra Leone.",

Rowntree was born in London in 1912 and held a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering. He worked as an engineering consultant for Alcott & Lomax, who would be acquired by Babtie in 2000. During his consulting career he was involved with the construction of water pumping stations. Rowntree was appointed director of the Water Resources Board (WRB), a national water planning body established in 1964. The WRB was dominated by civil engineers and focussed its efforts on implementing structural solutions to water resource problems. Rowntree was a keen proponent of that school of thought saying in 1962 that \\\"the solution of water supply problems … will require the construction and operation of large works and highly‐developed technical control\\\". Under Rowntree's leadership the WRB was able to undertake what was the largest scheme of water planning yet seen in England and Wales. Rowntree was made a Knight Bachelor in Elizabeth II's birthday honours on 13 June 1970. Rowntree gave the Institution of Electrical Engineers 1972 Graham Clark Lecture on \\\"Conservation and use of water resources\\\" and the same year wrote an article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society B entitled \\\"Water Resources Management in England and Wales\\\". By 1974 he had become a Professor and, on 2 December that year, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by City University London. Rowntree was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) for the November 1975–76 session. He used his inaugural presidential address to emphasise that \\\"the duty remains with engineers and other experts to minimise the range of intangible issues… the inaccuracy of words and the opportunities of distortion are enormous. In the present age of unreason this is a real danger and may be responsible for many of our present ills\\\". He was a chartered engineer and a fellow of the institution. In 1976 Rowntree was employed by the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and, on 8 December, gave the 63rd Thomas Hawksley lecture to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers on the history of water engineering.

Among his major wins as a jockey, Odom rode Banastar to victory in the 1901 Metropolitan Handicap and won the Woodlawn Vase trophy on three occasions.

Born in West Ham, London, Male trialled with West Ham United before playing with non-league Clapton. He joined Arsenal as an amateur in November 1929, turning professional in May 1930 and made his debut in a 7-1 victory over Blackpool on 27 December 1930. Initially a left-winger or left-half, usually deputising for Bob John. Male's appearances were few and far between - three in 1930-31 (in which Arsenal won the First Division for the first time in their history) and nine in 1931-32, although he was a surprise choice at left half in the 1932 FA Cup final after Alex James was withdrawn because of injury and the side reshuffled as a result. Arsenal controversially lost 2-1 to Newcastle United, after Newcastle's equaliser had come after the ball had already gone behind for a goal kick. In 1932, with Arsenal's current right back Tom Parker ageing and his replacement, Leslie Compton, not looking entirely assured, Male was converted from left half to right back by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman; Male would later recount how, before being told of the switch by Chapman, he entered his office fearing for his future at the club, but Chapman convinced him not only could he play at right back, but that he was the best right back in the country. Bolstered by Chapman's pep talk, Male slotted into the right back role easily, and he became a near ever-present for the next seven seasons; he was undisputed first-choice right back and played over 35 matches for every season in that period. During that time, Arsenal won the First Division four more times (1932-33, 1933-34, 1934-35 and 1937-38), as well as the FA Cup in 1935-36. Male's performances for club soon meant he was an international; he made his debut for England against Scotland on 14 November 1934 and went on to win nineteen caps for his country, captaining the team for six of them. By the end of the 1930s, Male was Arsenal captain, although injuries restricted his appearances in 1938-39. However, World War II intervened when Male was 29 and at the peak of his career; he played nearly 200 wartime matches for Arsenal, as well as serving in the Royal Air Force in Palestine. Upon the resumption of League football Male was 36, but still played 8 times in Arsenal's 1947-48 First Division-winning season, and thus became the first player in League history to play in six title-winning seasons. His last match for Arsenal was an 8-0 victory over Grimsby Town in May 1948. In all he played 318 matches for the Gunners, though he never scored a goal. After retiring from playing, Male became a coach at Arsenal, training the youth and reserve teams. He was later a scout, discovering, amongst others, Charlie George. He was still at the club to see it win its first Double in 1970-71, before retiring finally in 1975; he later emigrated to Canada to live with his son. Although at the time of his death in February 1998, at the age of 87, he was reported as being the last survivor of the Herbert Chapman era, Ray Bowden survived until September that year, and to a greater age (89).",

Maisel studied painting and graphic design at Manhattan's Cooper Union and at Yale University, and became a photographer in 1954. One of Maisel's most known images is his photograph of Miles Davis that appeared on the cover of Davis's album Kind of Blue. In 2009, Andy Baio created an image based on the original Kind of Blue album cover for the cover of a chiptune tribute album titled \\\"Kind of Bloop\\\".

For 40 years Maisel lived with his family in the historic Germania Bank Building in lower Manhattan. Built in 1898, the 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) single-family mansion contains 72 rooms over six floors.

The native of Kenosha, Wisconsin, stood 5 feet 11 inches (1.80 m) tall and weighed 185 pounds (84 kg). Hartman signed with his home-state Braves after graduation from Kenosha High School and began his minor league career in 1955. Three years later, he won 20 of 30 decisions for the Double-A Atlanta Crackers, tying for the Southern Association lead in wins and making the league's All-Star team. The following season, with the Triple-A Louisville Colonels, Hartman had another fine season, with a 10–3 win–loss record, and was recalled to the Braves for one game in April and two more in June. He worked in three losing efforts in middle relief and was ineffective in two of them, allowing six hits, five earned runs and two bases on balls in only 1 2⁄3 innings pitched. He returned to the Braves' farm system until June 24, 1962, when he was recalled from Louisville and traded to the Indians for infielder Ken Aspromonte. Two days later, he made his first Major League start against the Detroit Tigers in the second game of a twi-night doubleheader. Hartman lasted ten innings, allowed only three hits and one earned run with seven strikeouts, but left for a pinch hitter with the game tied, 1–1. Relief pitcher Gary Bell worked the next two innings and got credit for a 3–1 Cleveland win. In his next start five days later against the Chicago White Sox, Hartman started well with one run allowed in four innings, but in the fifth, he faced four batters and could not record an out, as Chicago scored three earned runs. Hartman made six more appearances as a relief pitcher for Cleveland in July 1962 before returning to the minor leagues, retiring in 1963 after nine professional seasons.

Ross began his career in railway engineering with the Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR) before moving to the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) in 1871. In 1873 he went to work for the North Eastern Railway (NER) before returning to LNWR in the next year. He changed employer again in 1884 when he went to work for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) before becoming the Chief Engineer of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR) in 1890. During his time at MS&LR he was responsible for the design of many of the works involved with that company's London Extension. In 1896 Ross became the Chief Engineer of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), a post he held until 1911 when he became an engineering consultant. During his time at GNR his advice was sought by the company's board on the locomotive design to be chosen for their no.1300 series of engines. Several designs were rejected as they were judged to be too long or heavy for the rail infrastructure. Despite several attempts at redesign by Nigel Gresley the series was scrapped in 1924. His works as an engineering consultant included the Hertford Loop Line and Breydon Viaduct, with Ross serving as the Engineer-in-Chief of the latter.

An attempt by producer Johnnie Hamp to reproduce the atmosphere of the working men's clubs in a television studio, Crompton was famous for ringing a hand-operated fire alarm bell and telling the audience to \\\"give order\\\" when making announcements from \\\"the committee\\\" in between acts. He wrote his own scripts, with occasional additions by Neil Shand. The MC for the show, Bernard Manning, claimed he was cast in the role because he \\\"had been on The Comedians and he had that gormless look about him so he was ideal.\\\" According to Johnnie Hamp: \\\"Colin was criticised by real club chairmen for the way he acted. One actual club chairman wanted to appear and have it out with him on the show. He came along and met Colin, who was dressed in a very good suit, very smart, and here was this man looking more of a caricature than Colin ever did.\\\" Later, Crompton also had a small role as 'Roughage' in the film Confessions from a Holiday Camp in 1977. A favourite moment during The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club was when he rang his bell to interrupt ventriloquist Ray Alan halfway through his act: \\\"...excuse me Mr. Allen we've had some complaints that they can't quite hear you at the back. Could you hold your dummy a little closer to the microphone please?\\\" This particular joke, like the character of the club chairman itself, owed a heavy debt to the comedian Norman Collier. In later life Colin bought and ran a pub called the Birch and Bottle in Whitley, Cheshire. Colin died of lung cancer at the age of 54. He was survived by his 3 children, Cheryl, Erica and John.",

Kxf7 5.Nxe4 Nc6 6.Qf3+ Kg8?? 7.Ng5! 1-0 Davids-Diggle, London Banks League 1949), Alexander affectionately christened Diggle \\\"the Badmaster\\\", a facetious counterpoint to the more familiar title Grandmaster. Diggle later adopted the sobriquet as a pseudonym, writing a series of articles in Newsflash under that name between 1974 and 1986. Chess historian Edward Winter wrote the following in his remembrance of Diggle in CHESS magazine: Specializing in nineteenth-century chess history (particularly the Staunton period), he brought the old masters to life with rare wit and shrewdness. These qualities also permeated his accounts of the idiosyncratic doings and sayings of club \\\"characters\\\", such as the elderly player \\\"who fumbled his way to perdition at reasonable speed until he was a queen and two minor pieces to the bad, after which he discovered that 'every move demanded the nicest calculation'\\\", or \\\"the Lincoln bottom board of 1922, who complained that he had 'lost his queen about the third move and couldn’t seem to get going after that'.\\\"A former county champion, G.H.D. was charmingly self-deprecatory in his reminiscences, as when he had a game adjudicated by Tartakower: \\\"The Great Master, having been fetched, sat down at the board very simply and unaffectedly, and drank in through his spectacles the fruits (and probably the whole deplorable history) of the Badmaster’s afternoon strategy.\\\"Little escaped G.H.D.'s eye, even towards the end. Modestly adapting Oscar Wilde, he claimed to have \\\"nothing to declare but his longevity\\\", simply adding that he had \\\"mingled from time to time with three generations of eminent players ranging from Isidor Gunsberg to Nigel Short, and rambled extensively round the highways and byways of provincial chess\\\". He was one of the game's most stylish chroniclers. In 1984 and 1987, Chess Notes published two collections of Diggle's Newsflash articles as Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster and Chess Characters: Reminiscences of a Badmaster, Volume II.",

            "Original Text": "Joseph Salim Peress (1896 – June 4, 1978), was a pioneering British diving engineer, inventor of one of the first truly usable atmospheric diving suits, the Tritonia, and was involved in the construction of the famous JIM suit. Salim Peress grew up in the Middle East. It is said that his interest in diving suit design started from the observations of the Persian Gulf pearl divers. Peress had a natural talent for engineering design, and had challenged himself to construct an articulated atmospheric diving suit (ADS) that would keep divers dry and at atmospheric pressure, even at great depth. At the time, little was known about decompression diving. Various atmospheric suits had been developed during the Victorian era, but nobody had yet managed to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure. In 1918 Peress began working for WG Tarrant at Byfleet, United Kingdom, where he was given the space and tools to develop his ideas about constructing an ADS. His first attempt was an immensely complex prototype machined from solid stainless steel. In 1923 Peress was asked to design a suit for salvage work on the wreck of the P&O liner SS Egypt which had sunk in 122 m (400 ft) of water off Ushant. He declined, on the grounds that his prototype suit was too heavy for a diver to handle easily, but was encouraged by the request to begin work on a new suit using lighter materials. By 1929 he believed he had solved the weight problem, by using cast magnesium instead of steel, and had also managed to improve the design of the suit's joints by using a trapped cushion of oil to keep the surfaces moving smoothly.The oil, which was virtually non-compressible and readily displaceable, allowed the limb joints to move freely at depths of 600 ft (180 m), where the pressure was 520 psi (35 atm). Peress claimed that the Tritonia suit's joints could function at 1,200 ft (370 m) although this was never proven. In 1930 Peress revealed the Tritonia suit. By May it had completed trials and was publicly demonstrated in a tank at Byfleet. In September Peress' assistant Jim Jarret dived in the suit to a depth of 123 m (404 ft) in Loch Ness. The suit performed perfectly, the joints proving resistant to pressure and moving freely even at depth. The suit was offered to the Royal Navy which turned it down, stating that Navy divers never needed to descend below 90 m (300 ft). Jim Jarret made a deep dive to 305 m (1,001 ft) on the wreck of the RMS Lusitania off south Ireland, followed by a shallower dive to 60 metres (200 ft) in the English Channel in 1937 after which, due to lack of interest, the Tritonia suit was retired. Peress abandoned work on diving suits and instead turned to pioneering work in plastic moulding, later forming a company which became the world's largest manufacturer of gas turbine blades for the aircraft industry. In 1965, Peress came back from retirement, starting his collaboration with two British engineers, Mike Humphrey and Mike Borrow, interested in designing a modern atmospheric diving suit. The first order of business was finding the original Tritonia suit, which turned up in a Glasgow warehouse. After all these years, the old suit was still in working conditions, and the octogenarian Peress became the first person to test it in a factory test tank. In 1969 Peress became a consultant to UMEL (Underwater Marine Equipment Limited), the new company formed by Humphrey and Borrow, which eventually created the JIM suit, which was named after Peress' diver Jim Jarret.",

The engineer spent their early years in a region known for pearl diving, which inspired an interest in creating a suit that would protect divers from water pressure at significant depths. The central engineering challenge was designing flexible, pressure-resistant joints.\n\nIn the late 1910s, the engineer began working for a firm where they could develop their ideas. An initial prototype was heavy and complex. A request for a deep-water salvage operation in the 1920s prompted a redesign using lighter materials. By the late 1920s, a new suit was developed using a lightweight metal and an innovative joint system that used a non-compressible fluid to maintain mobility under pressure.\n\nThe new suit was successfully tested in a tank in 1930. Later that year, a test diver achieved a significant depth in a deep freshwater lake. Despite this success, the suit was rejected by a national navy. The suit was used for a few more deep dives on shipwrecks in the following years before being retired due to a lack of commercial interest.\n\nThe engineer then shifted careers, moving into industrial manufacturing and building a successful company. Decades later, the engineer was approached by a new team interested in designing a modern atmospheric suit. The original suit was located and found to be still functional, and the engineer, then in their eighties, participated in its testing. The engineer subsequently acted as a consultant to the new company, which eventually produced the famous suit, named after the original test diver.",

In 1912, Chu Guiting began to study Xingyiquan (Shape and Mind Boxing) and Baguazhang (Eight Trigram Boxing) under Grandmaster Li Cunyi, who recognized him as his official disciple. At the age of twenty, Chu Guiting left his hometown and traveled extensively throughout China, visiting Beijing and Tianjin, Liaoning in the north, and Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang in the south. In 1921, Chu Guiting studied Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) in Hangzhou under Yang Chengfu – a direct descendent of the style's progenitor, Yang Lu-ch'an. In doing so, he became one of the \\\"Five Tiger Generals\\\". Between 1916 and 1940, Chu Guiting was heavily involved in martial arts in both Jiangsu and Shanghai. During this time he worked with the East China Five Province General's Bodyguards, the Central Chinese Boxing Association, the Zhejiang Province Chinese Boxing Association, the Central Police Officers Association, the Presidential Palace Bodyguards, the National Government's Military Department, and the Jiangsu Public Security Headquarters. He also taught Chinese martial arts privately. In 1928, General Li, General Zhang Zi Jiang, and General Fung Zu Ziang held the first full-contact national competition in Nanjing, China. The purpose was to find the best candidates for teaching positions at the government-sponsored Central Martial Arts Academy. Hundreds of the best Chinese martial artists participated in sanda, weapons, and shuai jiao. After several days, the fighting competitions were halted because too many competitors were seriously injured. Two died. Since the fights were stopped prematurely, 12 martial artists have historically been remembered as \\\"the champion\\\". Chu Guiting was one of them. During the 1950s, Chu Guiting settled in Shanghai and began to teach classes in Waitan Park, Fuxing Park, and the Peoples’ Park. He also taught classes for a wide range of companies including the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Government's Public Security Department, the Shanghai Electric Cable Factory, the Poplar Tree Beach Power Plant, and the Eternal Peace Company. In 1958, Chu Guiting was invited to become the Chinese National Martial Arts Committee's Assistant Director. Following this, he was invited with Wang Ziping and Lu Zhenduo to choreograph a sword dance for the Shanghai Song and Dance Institution, which won a silver medal at the World Youth Festival. In 1956, Chu Guiting, Cai Longyun, Fu Zhongwen, and Zhang Yu were commissioned by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Education Union to condense and simplify Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) into a general system that could be conveniently studied by the masses. Shortly afterwards, Chu Guiting, Gu Liuxin, and Fu Zhongwen were invited to Beijing to formulate the famous Simplified 24 and 28 Step Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist), forms that are still practiced throughout China today. Chu Guiting was a renowned teacher. It was his belief that in order to learn martial arts one must harmonize the body, the breath, and the mind. Many Chinese martial artists trace their lineage back to Chu Guiting, and he taught artists from other styles. For example, he taught Xingyiquan, Baguazhang, and Taijiquan to Chan Yik Yan. In teaching, Chu Guiting paid particular attention to the moral philosophy of Chinese martial arts, and would often say: \\\"With morals much can be achieved, without them nothing can be achieved. Consider, for example, somebody who studies a martial art but does not recognize its moral and philosophical depth. They will soon give it up because they have only ever tasted the skin of the grape and not the fruit that it contains.\\\" Chu Guiting died on 16 February 1977.",

In the early 20th century, this individual began training in internal martial arts under a prominent grandmaster, who recognized him as an official disciple. As a young adult, he left his hometown and traveled extensively throughout the country, visiting numerous cities in both the north and south.\n\nIn the 1920s, he studied a major style of taijiquan under a direct descendant of the style's founder, becoming known as one of its key proponents. For over two decades, he was heavily involved in martial arts activities in eastern China, working with various military, security, and boxing associations while also teaching privately.\n\nDuring the late 1920s, he participated in a significant national martial arts competition where, after the events were halted prematurely, a group of participants were historically remembered as champions; he was among them.\n\nIn the 1950s, he settled in a major city and began teaching public classes in several parks, as well as offering instruction to employees of various corporations and government departments. He later accepted a senior position on a national martial arts committee. During this period, he collaborated with other masters to choreograph a performance that won an award at an international festival.\n\nIn the mid-1950s, he was part of a committee tasked with condensing and simplifying a popular taijiquan form into a system accessible to the general public. This work contributed directly to the creation of standardized forms that remain widely practiced today.\n\nHe was a respected teacher who emphasized the harmony of body, breath, and mind. He believed deeply in the moral philosophy of martial arts, often stressing that technical skill without ethical understanding was incomplete. His teachings influenced many practitioners across different styles. He passed away in 1977.",

During his life he taught in various European countries, most notably in Denmark where he was the fencing instructor of King Christian IV. It was during his time in Copenhagen that he published his treatise on rapier fencing, Lo Schermo, overo Scienza d’Arme, in 1606. The treatise became a fencing bestseller around Europe, and was reprinted until 1713 and translated into several languages, notably into German, and again in 2005, into English. His treatise, first published by Henrico Waltkirch, is also regarded as one of the finest examples of baroque printing, with its 191 copperplate engravings by Jan van Haelbeck, Francesco Valeggio and possibly other artists. This book is also important to bibliophiles because it is the first Danish book to feature copperplate engravings. Fabris was also the Supreme Knight of the Order of the Seven Hearts, a chivalrous order of which we do not yet know much today.

Kleibacker was born in Cullman, Alabama on November 20, 1921. His family were the proprietors of a department store in the municipality. He attended the University of Notre Dame, where he majored in journalism, and worked for a time as a reporter for a newspaper in Alabama. He attended New York University for his graduate studies. While working at a clothing store in San Francisco, Kleibacker met singer Hildegarde and her manager Anna Sosenko at the hotel in which he was staying. He was hired as her driver, primarily because he owned a station wagon large enough to transport the singer's sizable entourage. On tour in Europe, Kleibacker met numerous fashion designers and came to the conclusion that he had an interest in the field while in the offices of Christian Dior. He submitted a series of his early designs while in Paris in 1954, and earned a post as an assistant at Lanvin. Back in New York City in 1957, Kleibacker worked for Nettie Rosenstein. He started his own collection in 1959 in a brownstone on the Upper West Side of Manhattan and by the mid-1960s was designing clothing for some of the city's most exclusive clothiers, including Henri Bendel, Bergdorf Goodman and Bonwit Teller. Hildegarde was one of his few private customers, as well as such notables as Diahann Carroll, Alicia Markova and Pat Nixon. He would design clothing in silk and wool crepe, preferring the bias cut as it allowed for designs that appeared to \\\"be cut, not stamped out\\\". Vogue editor Diana Vreeland was an early supporter. He joined the faculty of Ohio State University as Designer-in-Residence with the Historic Costume and Textiles Collection at the College of Human Ecology, where his work was part of a 2005 exhibit titled \\\"Sculpture and Drapery: The Art of Fashion\\\".

In 1979 he launched his own line, which was received so well that it earned him the Coty Award the very next year. The company folded in 1985 due to Vollbracht having accepted financial backing from Johnny Carson, which was withdrawn during Carson's bitter divorce from his third wife. Afterwards, Vollbracht published Nothing Sacred, a visual diary of his years in New York City and the many people he interacted with, and then moved to Florida to concentrate on his illustrations and art. In 1989, The New Yorker named him one of its top illustrators, and he would produce covers and other art for the next several years.

He helped the Padres win the 1996 National League Western Division championship, appearing in 33 games played — 21 after 31 July — and batting .315 with 29 hits, five doubles, one home run, seven runs batted in and seven stolen bases. In the field, he started at four different defensive positions: second base, third base, shortstop and right field. However, he did not appear in the postseason. In 11 seasons Shipley played in 582 games and had 1,345 at bats, 155 runs scored, 364 hits, 63 doubles, six triples, 20 home runs, 138 RBI, 33 stolen bases, 47 bases on balls, a .271 batting average, .302 on-base percentage, .371 slugging percentage, 499 total bases, 15 sacrifice hits, nine sacrifice flies and 7 intentional walks. Shipley's post-playing career began in 2000, when he was a roving minor league baserunning and infield instructor for the Montréal Expos. He then returned to the Padres as a professional scout, working for Towers, in 2001–2002. In 2003, Shipley followed former Padres executives Larry Lucchino and Theo Epstein to the Boston Red Sox, where he began as special assistant to the general manager, player development and international scouting. He was named a vice president in 2006, and was appointed senior vice president, international scouting, in 2009. In February 2011, Shipley was promoted again, when he was named senior vice president, player personnel and international scouting. However, weeks after Epstein departed the Red Sox for the Chicago Cubs in October 2011, Shipley was dismissed in an overhaul of the Boston front office under the team's new general manager, Ben Cherington.",

It was between 1871 and 1879 that they moved to Doncaster. None of the family details appear on the 1881 census, though the two daughters were christened in Doncaster 25 October 1881. At the age of 18, Jenkins was a fitter at Doncaster's Great Northern Railway works and got together a team of friends to play a match against the Yorkshire Institute for the Deaf and Dumb in September 1879. The game was drawn 4–4. On the way home they stopped for a breather at the Hall Cross on South Parade and decided to continue to play together and chose the name Doncaster Rovers. Jenkins was a constant feature on the teamlist in those early years, frequently named as captain up till January 1884. For the 1882−83 season he was elected team captain as well as club secretary. Jenkins continued to play for Rovers for a few years, as well as organising the club, though by 1888−89 he didn't appear on any club information.

He died in a crash at the Milwaukee Mile. In the 1955 Indianapolis 500, he stopped his car in a futile attempt to help Bill Vukovich when Vukovich's car crashed and burned during the race. He is one of only two drivers in Indy 500 history to stop a non-damaged car to help another driver, the other being Gary Bettenhausen. He received a sportsmanship award for his efforts, as well as the wrath of the car owner. In June 1956, Elisian was engaging in a wheel-to-wheel duel with Bob Sweikert, who had won the race in which Vukovich was killed, in a Sprint car race at Salem Speedway when Sweikert made contact with the rail, overleapt it and rolled over outside of the track, suffering fatal skull injuries. Elisian was exonerated as no collision had taken place. In the 1958 Indianapolis 500, Dick Rathmann and Elisian started the race on the front row, with Jimmy Reece on the outside of the front row. Elisian spun in Turn 3 of the first lap, and collected Rathmann, sending them both into the wall, and starting a 15-car pileup. According to A. J. Foyt, Pat O'Connor's car hit Reece's car, sailed fifty feet in the air, landed upside down, and burst into flames. Although medical officials said that O'Connor was probably killed instantly from a fractured skull, he was incinerated in the accident, in full view of fans and drivers. Widely blamed for the accident, Elisian was suspended by USAC (reinstated a few days later), and was shunned by the racing community. Rumors spread that Elisian tried to lead the first lap in order to pay gambling debts owed to a syndicate. In June 1958, Elisian collided with Jim Davis in a Sprint car race at New Bremen Speedway in Auglaize County, Ohio. After Davis had run over one of the wheels of Elisian's spinning car when trying to pass him at the south turn, both cars flipped over and slid down the track. Elisian sustained minor injuries, but Davis, who suffered a skull fracture and chest injuries, died at Memorial Hospital in St. Marys, Ohio. While absolved of blame in the incident, Elisian's unpopularity with drivers deepened. In September 1958, Elisian was suspended for being charged with passing fraudulent checks among other things, but reinstated as of end of May 1959. In August 1959, Elisian entered the USAC Indy car 200-mile (320 km) race at the \\\"Milwaukee Mile,\\\" known in those days as Wisconsin State Fair Park. Driving a metallic green Watson-style roadster owned by Ernie Ruiz, he crashed on lap 29 when he spun in oil from A. J. Foyt's engine. The car hit the wall, rupturing the fuel cell, and rolled over. Some sixty gallons of fuel caught fire, and took over nine minutes to extinguish. The crash claimed the life of Elisian.",

A former commercial farmer, he embarked on a career as a professional trainer in 1982. Jones trained at principally at Ellis Park Racecourse in Henderson, Kentucky, and at Oaklawn Park Race Track in Hot Springs, Arkansas, before coming into national prominence in 2007 with the front-running bay colt Hard Spun. Hard Spun brought Jones into the spotlight with his runner-up finishes in the Kentucky Derby and Breeder's Cup Classic, as well as impressive victories in the Lane's End, King's Bishop, and Kentucky Cup Classic Stakes. In 2008, Jones was again in the nation's spotlight, this time with the talented fillies Proud Spell and Eight Belles. He saddled Proud Spell to a decisive win over a sloppy track in the Kentucky Oaks (G1). (Proud Spell went on to win the Eclipse Award as top three-year-old filly that year, becoming Jones's first Eclipse Award winner.) The day after the Kentucky Oaks, Jones saddled his other top filly, Eight Belles, to run in the Kentucky Derby. Following the race, Eight Belles, the first filly to run second in the Derby in over one hundred years, broke both front legs and was humanely euthanized on the track. After Eight Belles' breakdown, Jones was accused of drugging the filly or running an unsound horse and received hate mail from people who felt that he was to blame for the tragedy. Tests done on Eight Belles proved she had run clean. In the summer, Jones announced that after one more year of training, he would retire, partially because he wanted to spend more time with his family. In 2009, Jones had two top Kentucky Derby hopefuls in Old Fashioned and Friesan Fire. Old Fashioned won the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct in a romp and became the early favorite for the Derby. He also won the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park by open lengths before he was upset by Win Willy in the Rebel Stakes. In the Arkansas Derby, Old Fashioned finished second to Papa Clem and was retired after it was discovered the son of Unbridled's Song had slab-fractured his knee. Friesan Fire impressed on his way to the Derby, sweeping the Lecomte, Risen Star, and the Louisiana Derby at Fair Grounds in Louisiana. In the 2009 Kentucky Derby, Friesan Fire was the favorite. He broke badly, was stepped on and bumped at the start of the race, suffered a bad trip, and faded to second-to-last place. Friesan Fire went on to run in the Preakness Stakes. Other Jones-trained horses, such as Just Jenda (a stakes-winning filly owned by Larry's wife, Cindy), Solar Flare, Maren's Meadow, Payton D'Oro, Kodiak Kowboy, and It Happened Again, continued to compete that season. On November 7, 2009, Jones retired, and his wife, Cindy, took over training duties at the barn. Jones became an assistant to Cindy and galloped horses in the mornings for her. The Joneses are based at Delaware Park in Wilmington, Delaware, in the summer, and at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in the winter.

Son of André Pilette and great grandson of Théodore Pilette, he followed the family path. He started his career by winning many go-kart races before being sent to England to the talent-spotting Jim Russell Racing School. This experience created the opportunity for him to be part of the cast for John Frankenheimer's movie Grand Prix, and later on Le Mans with Steve McQueen. On the circuit, Pilette raced for Carlo Abarth in 1963 and 1965, and in 1967 he started racing for the Belgian VDS team. He won the European Formula 5000 Championship in 1973 with a Chevron B24, and again in 1975 with a Lola T400. He also competed in the USA in Formula 5000. He also made 3 attempts at the Indy 500.

Hall in Somerville, Massachusetts, the daughter of John Gill Hall and Sarah Cushing. Little is known about her childhood. On September 7, 1881 she married Charles E. Ladd, a West Coast businessman and son of early Portland (Oregon) mayor William S. Ladd. She then moved to Portland with her new husband, and they soon settled into a very comfortable life with an elegant home overlooking the Willamette River. It is not known how Ladd became interested in photography or if she received any formal training. She joined the Oregon Camera Club in September 1899, and by early 1901 a number of her works were exhibited in San Francisco. In 1902, leading New York photographer Alfred Stieglitz formed the Photo-Secession, a group of American photographers who worked to promote photographic pictorialism, and he listed Ladd as an Associate Member. It is not known how he became aware of her photography or if he had even seen her photographs, since most of those she was then taking did not accord with the pictorial tradition. In 1903, Ladd began taking extended trips on the Columbia River on her friend and fellow photographer Lily White’s custom-built houseboat, the Raysark, which contained a darkroom. Some of her most famous photographs of the river were included in an exhibition in 2008 at the Portland Art Museum, \\\"Wild Beauty: Photographs of the Columbia River Gorge, 1867-1957\\\". Ladd had become a successful and highly regarded photographer by the early twentieth century, and many of her photographs were published in The Pacific Monthly magazine (founded by her husband). After about 1904, Ladd’s other responsibilities took time away from her photography. She assisted her husband when he became involved in the preparations for Portland’s 1905 Lewis and Clark Centennial Exposition. In 1910, the Ladds moved to Carlton, Oregon, after Charles became president of the Carlton Consolidated Lumber Company. In spite of these additional obligations, Ladd exhibited fourteen photographs at the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition in San Francisco. Ladd became prominent in the Christian Science movement from 1911. After her husband died in 1920, she moved to Carmel, California, in late 1924 to join her long-time friend, Lily White.

He also competed in a few Formula Junior and Formula Two races before he finally moved into Formula One, failing to qualify Wolfgang Seidel's Lotus 18 at the non-Championship 1962 Pau Grand Prix before retiring the same car from the Solitude Grand Prix that year with engine failure. The first appearance of his Borgward-engined Lotus was delayed through problems preparing the engine, and Kuhnke missed four races he had entered in the second half of 1962. This engine was an old Sports Car unit, equipped with twin cams and direct fuel injection. In 1963, Kuhnke failed to qualify his BKL Lotus at the Rome Grand Prix, along with team-mate Ernst Maring, and both cars suffered engine failures at the Solitude Grand Prix in July. His single World Championship Formula One entry was at the 1963 German Grand Prix where he failed to qualify by a considerable margin. The BKL Lotus was simply an ordinary Lotus, lightly modified by Kuhnke, the initials standing for Borgward Kuhnke Lotus. After this, he retired from the Kanonloppet at the Karlskoga Circuit in Sweden with fuel injection problems, before moving away from Formula One as a driver. He subsequently entered two BKL Lotus cars in the 1964 Solitude Grand Prix for Maring and German helicopter pilot Joachim Diel.

He went on to win the event in 1984 and 1986. Qualifying as a grandmaster in 1989, he went on to tie for first place at the 1990 USSR Championship in Leningrad (the title going to Alexander Beliavsky on tie-break). He placed 5th-9th the following year at the final (58th) Soviet Championship, held in Moscow. These championship successes contributed to his selection for the national team and this included participating at the 1992 Manila Olympiad. Playing reserve board 2, he scored +3 =6 −0, helping the Russian team to the gold medal. Among his international tournament successes were wins at Nałęczów 1986 and Tashkent 1987.

In 1838, he became a technician or préparateur in this then, as now, famous institution. In 1841, he became assistant-naturalist. He accompanied Henri Milne-Edwards (1800—1885) and Jean Louis Armand de Quatrefages de Breau (1810—1892) to Sicily on a marine zoology expedition. He published, in 1845 a Histoire des insectes, or History of the insects and, in 1854—1856 Zoologie agricole or Agricultural Zoology. This last work is remarkable: it presents in a precise way the harmful or pest species and the damage they cause to various crop plants. This work was illustrated by his father. Next he published an atlas of the anatomy of the vertebrates which appeared between 1852 and 1864. This publication raised his hopes to obtain the chair of reptiles and fish at the Natural History Museum left vacant by the death of Auguste Duméril (1812—1870) but it was finally Léon Vaillant (1834—1914) who was selected.

His natural position was shortstop, but he had the misfortune to be with the White Sox while Chico Carrasquel played the position, followed by all-time great Luis Aparicio. A native of Alquízar, Cuba, Rodríguez played in the Negro Leagues with the New York Cubans, 1939 and 1944, and in the Mexican League, 1945–46 (Riley, 676) prior to the integration of organized baseball, Before the 1951 season, Rodríguez was acquired by the Brooklyn Dodgers from the Tuneros de San Luis Potosí of the Mexican League. He was assigned to Brooklyn's farm club, the Montreal Royals, where he batted .302. On December 6 of that same year he was traded by the Dodgers to the Chicago White Sox for first baseman Rocky Nelson. Rodríguez was Chicago's regular third baseman during the 1952 season. He appeared in 124 games for the 81–73 White Sox and hit .265 with 1 home run and 40 runs batted in. He drew 47 walks and was hit by pitches 3 times, raising his on-base percentage to .346.

Rodríguez went back to the minor leagues in 1953, and on October 8 of that year was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League for pitcher Don Johnson. While Rodríguez never again made it back to the big league level, he had an outstanding career with the Toronto Maple Leafs when they were the top-drawing team in the International League during the 1950s. He teamed with second baseman Mike Goliat to turn spectacular double plays. Rodríguez was so good at the position, the White Sox sent a film crew to Toronto to record his skill at turning double plays to be used in training their minor league shortstops.

She played between 1938 and 1959, and was considered a top 20 player, winning the Irish Open (1950), Israel International (1950), Cologne International (1951), Baden-Baden (1951) and Welsh International (1954), and several times the Rio de la Plata Championship.

She also won two gold and bronze medals at the 1951 Pan American Games. Mary Terán was persecuted by the military dictatorship which came to power in 1955 because of her sympathy and identification with the Peronist Movement, forcing her into exile in Spain and Uruguay and to retire from tennis at the end of the 1950s, and excluding her from all recognition, by the press and also sport organizations. Until the 1980s, Argentina's tennis was a sport for the upper classes. Mary Terán confronted the leaders of the Argentine Tennis Association, with the goal of promoting tennis among common people.

The style is referred by several names including Tomiki Aikido, Shodokan Aikido and Sport Aikido. Tomiki was one of the early students of the founder of aikido Morihei Ueshiba, beginning in 1926, and also of Jigoro Kano, the founder of judo. In 1928 he obtained 5th dan in judo and in the following year he represented Miyagi Prefecture in the first judo tournament held in front of the Emperor—this tournament became the All Japan Tournament the following year. From 1936 till the end of the second world war he lived in Manchukuo (Manchuria) where he taught aikibudo (an early name for aikido) to the Kanton army and the Imperial Household Agency. In 1938 he became an assistant professor at Kenkoku University in Manchukuo. He went on to be awarded the first 8th dan in aikido (1940) and an 8th dan in judo (1978). After returning from a three-year internment by the Soviet Union, he taught both judo and aikido for many years at Waseda University. It was there that he formulated and expanded his theories concerning both kata based training methods and a particular form of free-style fighting which would put him at odds with much, but not all, of the aikido world. It was this action on the part of Tomiki of attempting to convert aikido into a sport that led to a schism with the founder Morihei Ueshiba and the Aikikai around this time. Tomiki was urged by the Aikikai to adopt a different name for his art other than “aikido” if he intended to introduce such a system of competition. Convinced of the need to modernize aikido, he stood his ground and persisted in his efforts to evolve a viable form of competition. In 1953, Tomiki along with 9 other martial art instructors were selected to tour US Air Force bases in the United States and was thus the first aikido instructor to visit the US. Tomiki is perhaps best known in the judo world for his influence in the developing of Kodokan Goshin Jutsu kata. His work Judo, published in 1956, is considered a classic. The aikido appendix to the book is thought to be the earliest English language text on aikido. In 1967, Tomiki opened his Shodokan Dojo which he used as a testing ground for his theories on aikido and competition. In 1970, Tomiki retired from Waseda University and, in the same year, presided over the first All-Japan Student Aikido Tournament. The basic rules for the holding of aikido tournaments had been worked out by this time in what would become an ongoing experiment to develop a viable form of competitive aikido. In 1974, he founded the Japan Aikido Association (JAA) from an earlier organization of the same name to promote his theories. Tomiki set up a new dojo for the Shodokan in Osaka on March 28, 1976 with the support of Masaharu Uchiyama, Vice-Chairman of the J.A.A. This dojo was intended to function as the headquarters of the Japan Aikido Association and Tomiki served as its first director. The current head of the dojo and chief instructor of the Shodokan Aikido Federation is Tetsuro Nariyama. Professor Tomiki died on December 24, 1979 leaving his closest disciple, Hideo Ohba as head of the Japan Aikido Association (JAA).",

The crude woodcuts for book assembling contemporary fashion from across the world, De gli Habiti Antichi e Modérni di Diversi Parti di Mondo published in Venice in 1590 by Cesare as if they were his works, may in fact belong to Christopher Krieger from Nuremberg. They depict the garb, sometimes fanciful and imagined, of individuals, men and women, from Tsars to Tribeswomen from the Arabian Desert to Muscovite nobles to Arabian nobles to Inca nobles. Cesare also published a book of prints depicting the jewels of royal crowns, titled Corona delle nobili e virtuose donne (1591).

Following his graduation from University College London one of his first jobs was the construction of a dam in Maentwrog in Wales. Paton later became an expert on dams and much of his career was devoted to their construction. In 1931 he undertook an economic survey of Canada which recommended a programme of works for its port system. This report was still being used into the 1970s. During the Second World War Paton was involved with the construction of gun emplacements in the Dardanelles, Turkey and of caissons for the Mulberry Harbours used after the Invasion of Normandy. After the Second World War, Paton undertook an economic survey of Syria, which made recommendations for port, water infrastructure, irrigation and hydroelectric improvements. This was followed by a similar report on Lebanon and one on the possibility of extending railways from Northern Rhodesia to neighbouring countries. From 1946, Paton worked almost exclusively on hydroelectric projects, beginning with the Owen Falls Hydroelectric Scheme in Uganda. He also worked on the Kariba Dam in Zambia and Zimbabwe, which was the largest dam in the world when built and for which he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George. He was also involved with the Indus Basin Project, the Aswan High Dam, the Hendrik Verwoerd Dam, the P.K. Le Roux Dam, the Spioenkop Dam and the Tarbela Dam. Paton was knighted in 1973 and retired in 1977, remaining a senior consultant to Gibb and Partners. He spent his retirement in Jersey, where he died at St Helier on 7 April 1999.

Together with Toon Hermans and Wim Sonneveld, he is considered to be one of the Great Three of Dutch cabaret. In 1936, he established the ABC Cabaret, which soon became one of the most successful Dutch cabaret groups, in which several artists debuted who later became famous. In 1940, the ABC Cabaret was touring the Dutch East Indies, and because of the German invasion could not return to the Netherlands. After the Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies, he was deported to camps at the Burma Railway. Because of his experiences at these camps he later agitated against Hirohito's visit to the Netherlands in 1971. Wim Kan is possibly best known as the originator of the tradition of the so-called \\\"Oudejaarsconferences\\\". These are performances of political cabaret on (or around) New Year's Eve, discussing the events of the past year. Wim Kan made the first oudejaarsconference in 1954, which was broadcast on radio. His first televised oudejaarsconference was in 1973, scoring an audience measurement of 75% and record appreciations rating of 8.8 (out of 10). Although he actually made only 5 television conferences (1973, 1976, 1979, 1981, 1982), they made such an impact that many people remember it as a yearly tradition.",

These experiences later influenced the artist's political activism, including opposition to a controversial state visit decades later.\n\nThe performer is widely credited with establishing the tradition of annual year-end political cabaret specials. The first such performance was broadcast on radio in the 1950s, with television adaptations beginning in the early 1970s.

He has written multiple books on comedy, mostly collections of gags and \\\"one-liners\\\" originally written for his newsletter, Orben's Current Comedy, and he has also written books for magicians. Robert Orben published his first gag book at the age of 18 in 1946, when he was working in Stuart Robson Jr.'s (stage manager for Florenz Ziegfeld) conjuror's shop in New York. Professional magicians would use his gags to add humor to their acts; comedians also came into magic stores, for props and books, as there were no comedy stores or resources as such at that time. When Robert Orben wrote his first gag book, Encyclopedia of Patter, it proved very popular, and he started publishing more books of gags, complete with sketches, ad libs, bits of business and routines. Titles included Patter Parade, Laugh Package, Sight Bits, and Screamline Comedy. By the 1950s, Orben gag books were ubiquitous in the comedy profession and were probably overused by stand-up comedians. Orben has said he nearly sued Lenny Bruce once, as Bruce advertised his show with the tag line, \\\"No Joe Miller, no corn, no Orben\\\". However, Orben never sued, and only saw Bruce perform once, shortly before Bruce's death. In addition to his gag and humor books, he started publishing a regular newsletter of topical humor, Orben's Current Comedy, which he wrote for nearly 30 years, stopping in 1989. Other comedy writers, including Gary Apple and Daniel R. White, attempted to keep the newsletter going, under the name Current Comedy, but none were able to halt the decline of subscriptions, and eventually the rights to it were sold. As Orben's books began to attract attention, he started writing custom-made gags for comedian Dick Gregory for six years. Gregory had contacted him in 1955, when Gregory was starting out in Chicago. Orben told him to get in touch when he'd found his own comedic voice. In 1962, Gregory telegrammed Orben, saying there would be a two-page article in Time about him. Orben bought the magazine and saw the article, and shortly after, the two signed a contract to work together. Orben also wrote for Jack Paar on The Tonight Show in New York City (1962–63), and the Red Skelton Show in Hollywood (1964–70). Later, Orben moved into politics, and in 1973 he became head speechwriter to Vice President Gerald R. Ford. When Ford succeeded to the Presidency in August, 1974, Orben became his speechwriter. In January 1976 he was appointed Special Assistant to President Ford and Director of the White House Speechwriting Department. As of 2007, Orben works as a speaker for corporate events. His most recent book is Speaker's Handbook of Humor. Never raise your hand to your children; it leaves your midsection unprotected.Quit worrying about your health. It'll go away.Time flies.

The TKS module was already docked to the Salyut and Vasyutin was due to lead an extended programme of military space experiments. However Vasyutin fell ill soon after arriving at the station and was unable to perform his duties. Although he was originally scheduled to have a six-month stay aboard Salyut 7, his illness forced the crew to make an emergency return to Earth after only two months. His illness is said to have been caused by a prostate infection, which had manifested itself as inflammation and a fever. He graduated from Higher Air Force School and from Test Pilot School, both in Kharkov. He was a Lieutenant General in the Soviet Air Forces, and took cosmonaut basic training in August 1976.

The moniker was coined by Bob Hunt, an NBL announcer at the 1982 NBL Grand Nationals that Tommy raced in. Many racers received their monikers from the pithy play by play race announcers. Tommy Brackens was a former motorcycle motocross (MX) racer that made the switch to BMX in 1977 (he would return to MX after his BMX career). Quiet, shy and highly likable he was believed to have all the talents to be truly a top level racer. If Mr. Brackens was likable he had a strong desire to be liked. One of his goals was to be voted as the fan favorite among kids as their favorite racer; \\\"...to be the people's favorite is my goal.\\\" he said. That goal was fulfilled in 1987 When he won BMX Action's Number One Racer Award (NORA) Cup for that year. Unfortunately his inconsistency prevented him from winning a national number one plate for any association amateur or professional. The closest was a National No. 2 with the NBL in 1986. He failed to transfer out of his semi (crashed) while only a few points behind the eventual No.1 for that year, Pete Loncarevich (who was not doing well himself at the time and barely qualified for the main). However, he did win the 1986 IBMXF World Championship. 1986 was a good year by any measure.",

A serious professional misconduct hearing opened following complaints brought by four doctors from the main NHS Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross hospital, west London, and some of his former patients. It is alleged that he breached international standards of care, set by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (HBIGDA) by inappropriately prescribing cross-gender hormones to patients and referring them for sex reassignment surgery without adequate assessment.

She was a switch-hitter and threw right-handed. Born in Ocala, Florida, Mava Lee Thomas was the only player in AAGPBL history whose father played in Major League Baseball. Her father, Herb Thomas, was a center fielder/second baseman for the Boston Braves and New York Giants in parts of three seasons spanning 1924–1927. In the fourth grade, Thomas learned her baseball skills from her father, who taught her the importance of competition, practice, adversity, and teamwork. ′′Tommie′′, as her father dubbed her, attended several schools while growing up in Florida because Mr. Thomas worked as a coach and scout for the Giants organization. She heard about the AAGPBL while attending Ocala High School, where she played for the VFW team. The AAGPBL operated from 1943 to 1954 and gave over 600 women athletes the opportunity to play professional baseball and to play it at a level never before attained. The league was conceived by Philip K. Wrigley during World War II, under the idea of initiating the innovative project to maintain interest in baseball as the military draft was depleting major-league rosters of first-line players and attendance declined at ballparks around the country. After graduating from school, Thomas attended an AAGPBL tryout at Fort Wayne, Indiana. The switch-hitter made the grade and joined the Fort Wayne Daisies for the 1951 season. Thomas earned $75 per week plus expenses with the Daisies, which was a considerable amount of money in those days, even though the girls played six nights a week and a doubleheader on Sundays. She was mostly used as a backup for Mary Rountree (C) and Jean Weaver (3B). At the end of the season, Thomas became concerned that poor attendance indicated an uncertain future for the league. Then, she was determined to continue playing ball and went into the US Navy to play in the female softball team, serving also as a member of the Armed Forces Recreation Society. After discharge in 1953, she played exhibition games for the Hagerstown Mollies of Maryland during two years. She got married in 1953, but the marriage lasted only two years. Thomas also finished a degree in recreation at the University of Florida and went to work for the Ocala Parks and Recreation Department in 1984, helping to establish such events as Light Up Ocala and the annual fishing derby at Tuscawilla Park, before retiring in 1995. In 1988, Thomas received further recognition when she became part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. In addition, Thomas and her father became the only father/daughter combination to be inducted into the Florida Baseball Hall of Fame. The AAGPBL folded in 1954. Lady pitchers, catchers, and fielders drifted into obscurity until 1992 when the film A League of Their Own was released. The film kindled a renewed interest in these trailblazers who have their own places in American history. While the film does not use real names, filmmaker Penny Marshall seemed to be aiming for realism, as her work includes fake newsreel footage and pseudo-documentary present day scenes at the beginning and end of the fictitious story. Since then, Thomas and her teammates have become the darlings of the media. They have been honored several times for their significant contributions, responding to request for autographs and corresponding with young athletes interested in hearing of their days in the AAGPBL. Thomas felt proud to be the only girl ball player with a major league father. She remembered him into playing an old-timers game in 1988 when he was 87 years old.

This means: \\\"Jacob Acker, painter in Ulm has completed this painting on the day of the holy cross in the year of 1483\\\". Not much is known about this Jacob Acker \\\"der Jüngere\\\" (the younger). Most probably he belonged to the extended Ulm artist family of the Acker, many of them members of the so-called \\\"Ulmer Schule\\\" (school of Ulm). This dynasty of artists started with Jakob Acker \\\"dem Älteren\\\" (the elder), who lived around 1400. He painted some of the glass windows of the Ulm cathedral today still existing. His son Hans Acker (about 1380-1461) continued with this profession and also his glass windows still can be admired in the Ulm cathedral. Whether Jacob Acker \\\"der Juengere\\\" is a son or brother of Hans Acker is not known. But it is known that Jakob Acker d. J. had produced doors with paintings for the main organ of the Ulm cathedral. This organ and Jakob Acker's doors are lost. In 1529 Ulm converted to Protestantism; under the radical influence of the reformer Zwingli on the so-called “Götzentag” during summer 1531 the people of Ulm burned most paintings, altars and organs of the Ulm cathedral in a huge fire on the square in front of the cathedral. The Germans called this fundamentalist Protestant religious movement \\\"die Bilderstürmer\\\" (iconoclasts). Because Risstissen, some 12 miles southwest of Ulm, then only partially owned by the city of Ulm remained Roman Catholic, Jakob Acker's remarkable Risstissen altar survived.

Belden was born in San Francisco into a wealthy California family. His grandfather, Josiah Belden, was an early California pioneer who made millions in San Francisco real estate and was the first Mayor of San Jose. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Belden bought his first camera to record a European tour with his school friend, Eugene Phelps. The highlight of the tour was a journey through Russia in Belden's 1908 Packard, the first automobile to make such a trip in the country. After the trip, Belden went to work as a cowboy on the Phelps (Pitchfork) Ranch in Wyoming. In 1912, Belden married Eugene's sister, Frances. The couple had three children, Annice, Margot, and Mary Elizabeth, who died while still a toddler. Eugene's father died in 1922, leaving Eugene and Charles to take over management of the Pitchfork Ranch. Belden's 1921–1940 photographs of the Pitchfork Ranch were widely published, including in The Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, and on the cover of Life magazine. Airplanes became a fascination for Belden. In the late 1920s, Charles became involved in raising antelope and sending them by airplane to zoos around the world, including some to Germany in the Hindenburg. He helped to pioneer the process of planting fish from the air and filmed the experience for future reference. In addition, he helped the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission conduct a census of wildlife herd populations using aerial photographs. Estate taxes, mismanagement, and an agricultural depression that began in 1921 took their toll on the Pitchfork and the ranch fell into decline. To meet expenses, in the 1930s the family turned their home into a dude ranch, but this response did not stop the financial drain. After many years of strained relations, Charles divorced Frances in 1940 and moved to Florida with a new wife, Verna Steele Belden.

On August 15, 2001, Carrara combined with fellow Venezuelan pitchers Omar Daal, Kelvim Escobar, and Freddy García to win their respective starts: Carrara, of the Dodgers, facing Montreal, 13–1; Daal, in a Phillies victory over the Brewers, 8–6; Escobar, of the Blue Jays, over Oakland, 5–2, and García, of Seattle, against the Red Sox, 6–2.

Stoute, whose father was the Chief of Police for Barbados, left the island in 1964 at the age of 19 to become an assistant to trainer Pat Rohan and began training horses on his own in 1972. His first win as a trainer came on 28 April 1972 when Sandal, a horse owned by Stoute’s father, won at Newmarket Racecourse in England. Since then, he has gone on to win races all over the globe, including victories in the Dubai World Cup, the Breeders Cup, the Japan Cup and the Hong Kong Vase. He was knighted in 1998 for services to tourism in Barbados. He was the only trainer in the 20th century to win an English Classic in five successive seasons and has been Champion Trainer ten times (1981, 1986, 1989, 1994, 1997, 2000, 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2009). He was the trainer for Kribensis, who is the only horse to have won the Triple Crown of Hurdling, doing so in the 1989/90 racing season. Stoute also trained Shergar, arguably his most famous horse, who won the 1981 Epsom Derby and was later stolen, presumably by the IRA. In 2009, three horses trained by Stoute—Conduit, Tartan Bearer and Ask—pulled off a rare feat when the trio made a clean sweep of the placings at the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes. In all, the horses took home $1,787,000 of the $2,008,945 prizemoney in Britain's richest horserace. Those wins helped him regain his Champion Trainer title in 2009, winning a total of £3,372,287 in prize money. In 2013 he trained the Queen's horse Estimate to Gold Cup victory.

Considered by many to be one of the more colourful characters on the chess circuit, he has an extraordinary talent for rapid chess, which has been demonstrated at some of the world's most prestigious 'speed chess' tournaments. In 2005, he finished second at the Tallinn (Keres Memorial) rapid event, behind Alexey Shirov but ahead of such luminaries as Anatoly Karpov and Boris Gelfand. The same year, he took the silver medal at the European Rapid Championship, behind the strong Hungarian Grandmaster (GM) Zoltan Gyimesi. His sustained efforts were again rewarded in 2006, when at the Ajaccio Open Rapid event, he finished clear winner, ahead of a large group of strong GMs and Super-GMs including Kasimdzhanov, Milov, Bareev, Motylev, Bologan, Almasi, Smirin, Sokolov, Naiditsch, Sasikiran and Van Wely. Whilst it is rare that older players can achieve this kind of success against more youthful talents, it is not completely unknown. Yuri Balashov is another mature player who enjoys success in such events and it is probable that good quality rapid chess relies as much on intuition as calculation and stamina, giving the experienced professional good chances against younger, sharper, but less knowledgeable minds. Malaniuk has also been a strong player at standard time limits, winning many national and international tournaments, including Minsk 1985, Kostroma 1985 (USSR Ch. Semi-final), Lvov 1986 and Frunze 1987 on the road to securing his Grandmaster title (awarded in 1987). There were further victories recorded at Forlì in 1990 and 1992, Porto San Giorgio 1994, Minsk 1997 Krasnodar 2001, Arkhangelsk 2002, Krasnodar 2002, Koszalin 2002, Kolobrzeg 2003, Kraków 2003 and Mielno 2006. Notable runner-up performances include Baku 1983, Tallinn 1987, Lvov 1988, Świdnica 2001 and Kraków 2004. He was a regular participant of the Soviet Championships between 1983 and 1991; his best finish occurring in 1986, when he shared second place behind Vitaly Tseshkovsky. In Ukraine, he has thus far been the national champion on three occasions, in 1980, 1981 and 1986. In team chess, he played for Ukraine in the Moscow 1994, Yerevan 1996 and Elista 1998 Chess Olympiads, winning team silver and bronze medals in '96 and '98, respectively. Malaniuk has been credited with an important contribution to chess opening theory. Along with Sergey Dolmatov, Mikhail Gurevich and Evgeny Bareev, his faithful adherence to the Leningrad Dutch Defence (described as a hybrid of the Dutch and the King's Indian) helped shape a dynamic new approach to the system in the 1980s and this led to a dramatic resurgence of interest. That it affords black the opportunity to unbalance the position and fight for the full point is probably its main attraction. The system has since become a popular choice for players at all levels, following the publication of a number of books and theoretical guides. In a more minor capacity, he and Vladimir Akopian are noted for their attempts at reviving the Spielmann Variation (4.Qb3) of the Nimzo-Indian Defence, but have not met with any real success. In 2001, Russian player and chess journalist Evgeny Atarov reported that Malaniuk was severely ill and was undergoing a number of surgical operations, the funding of which had become a cause for concern.",

She championed both early and contemporary music, performing Giancarlo Menotti Darius Milhaud, Leon Weiner (with whom she had studied in Budapest) and, of course, Bartók, who admired her interpretations of his works. She also made the first recording by a woman of Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition in 1951. In 1949, the American State Department named Sari Biro the most distinguished new citizen of the year. Also in that year, she became the only woman to perform nine piano concertos in three concerts at Carnegie Hall. She moved to San Francisco in the late 1950s. She gave her last New York recital in 1972, but continued to give master classes until 1990. In contrast to her fragile appearance, her playing was powerful and commanding, and the elan and sense of communication in her performances made her a powerful advocate of the neglected music that she championed The Sari Biro Memorial Award was established in 1995 at the Franz Liszt Music Academy in Budapest, Hungary. The award is given each March 24 (Mme. Biro's birthday) in the form of a monetary prize to an outstanding young piano student at the academy.",
            "Anonymized Text": "A European pianist (born in March 1912, died in September 1990) expressed the belief that a performer should serve as a clear channel for the composer's message, extending rather than absorbing. This musician began piano lessons at a young age in their native city and later earned a scholarship to a prestigious music academy in their home country. There, they quickly gained recognition and were selected as a soloist for an important inaugural concert with a prominent conductor.\n\nIn the late 1930s, the pianist relocated to North America, where they established a career as a recitalist. Based in a major East Coast city for nearly two decades, they toured extensively and became known for radio broadcasts that featured a diverse repertoire. In the late 1950s, they also pioneered a series of television programs discussing and performing various musical works.\n\nThe artist was recognized for championing both early and contemporary music, including works by several notable composers. They made significant early recordings of major piano works and received a distinguished citizenship award from their adopted country in the late 1940s. Around that time, they achieved a notable milestone by performing multiple concertos in several concerts at a famous hall.\n\nAfter moving to the West Coast in the late 1950s, the pianist continued performing into the early 1970s and taught master classes until the final year of their life. Despite a delicate physical presence, their playing was described as powerful and communicative, particularly in advocating for underrepresented repertoire. A memorial award was established in their honor at their alma mater in the mid-1990s, presented annually on their birthday to promising piano students.",
