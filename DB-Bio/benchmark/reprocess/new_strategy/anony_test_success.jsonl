{"text": "Kurt Edward Fishback is an American photographer noted for his portraits of other artists and photographers. Kurt was born in Sacramento, CA in 1942. Son of photographer Glen Fishback and namesake of photographer Edward Weston, he was exposed to art photography at an early age as his father's friends included Edward Weston, Ansel Adams and Wynn Bullock. Kurt studied art at Sacramento City College, SFAI, Cornell University and UC Davis where he received his Master of Fine Arts Degree studying with Robert Arneson, Roy DeForest, William Wiley and Manuel Neri. Ceramic Sculpture was the first medium that gained him high visibility in the Art World. Kurt took up photography in 1962 when he asked his Father to teach him. After finishing graduate work and teaching fine art media at several colleges, Kurt was asked to teach at his father's school of photography in Sacramento. The series of artist portraits which now number over 250 were begun in 1979. Since 1963 Kurt has been involved in many solo and group exhibitions including; SFMOMA, and Crocker Art Museum. His work is represented in many public, private and corporate collections including; SFMOMA, SFAI, and Museum of Contemporary Crafts, New York, NY. Today, Kurt lives in Sacramento, California with his wife Cassandra Reeves. He exhibits at galleries and museums, teaches photography at American River College, and has published several books including a book of portraits of California artists entitled, Art in Residence: West Coast Artists in Their Space (see illustration). The book includes portraits of 74 artists, including Ansel Adams, Wayne Thiebaud, Judy Chicago, Brett Weston, and Jock Sturges. Other artist portraits made by Kurt include Cornell Capa, André Kertész, Mary Ellen Mark, Chuck Close and Robert Mapplethorpe. Kurt is represented by Appel Photography Gallery in Sacramento, CA and The Camera Obscura Gallery in Denver, CO.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Kurt_Edward_Fishback", "word_count": 302, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Kurt Edward Fishback", "anonymized_text": "An American artist is recognized for creating portraits of fellow creators.

{"text": "Henry Benjamin \\\"Hank\\\" Greenberg (born Hyman Greenberg; January 1, 1911 – September 4, 1986), nicknamed \\\"Hammerin' Hank\\\", \\\"Hankus Pankus\\\" or \\\"The Hebrew Hammer\\\", was an American professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily for the Detroit Tigers as a first baseman in the 1930s and 1940s. A member of the Baseball Hall of Fame, he was one of the premier power hitters of his generation and is widely considered as one of the greatest sluggers in baseball history. He had 47 months of military service including service in World War II, all of which took place during his major league career. Greenberg played the first twelve of his thirteen seasons in the major leagues on the Detroit team. He was an American League (AL) All-Star for four seasons and an AL Most Valuable Player in 1935 (first baseman) and 1940 (left fielder). He had a batting average over .300 in eight seasons, and he was a member of four Tigers World Series teams which won two championships (1935 and 1945). He was the AL home run leader four times and his 58 home runs for the Tigers in 1938 equaled Jimmie Foxx's 1932 mark for the most in one season by anyone but Babe Ruth, and tied Foxx for the most home runs between Ruth's record 60 in 1927 and Roger Maris' record 61 in 1961. Greenberg was the first major league player to hit 25 or more home runs in a season in each league, and remains the AL record-holder for most RBIs in a single season by a right-handed batter (183 in 1937, a 154-game schedule). Greenberg was the first Jewish superstar in American team sports. He attracted national attention in 1934 when he refused to play on Yom Kippur, the holiest holiday in Judaism, even though he was not particularly observant religiously and the Tigers were in the middle of a pennant race. In 1947, Greenberg signed a contract with a $30,000 raise to a record $85,000 before being sold to the Pittsburgh Pirates where he played his final MLB season that year. He was one of the few opposing players to publicly welcome Jackie Robinson that year to the major leagues.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "BaseballPlayer", "wiki_name": "Hank_Greenberg", "word_count": 369, "label": "Baseball Player", "people": "Hank Greenberg", "anonymized_text": "An individual, recognized by various informal monikers, was a celebrated figure in a popular American team sport during the mid-20th century.

His performance remained consistently strong over many seasons, and he contributed to teams that secured top honors in their competitions.

Jackie Robinson is a key figure in breaking racial boundaries, but he did not serve in the military during his career, and the details of encouraging a peer and multiple MVPs align more closely with players like Hank Aaron or Willie Mays. However, the combination of military service, two MVPs, and support for integration peers strongly points to **Larry Doby** or figures like Roy Campanella, but Campanella's career was shortened by injury. The most consistent match across all clues is **Hank Aaron**, though some details (like military service) are less precise. After cross-referencing, the profile is a composite with strongest alignment to **Jackie Robinson** (for pioneering and social impact) but with award and performance elements from others. Given the integration peer clue, Robinson's support for others like Don Newcombe or his broader impact stands out, but Robinson didn't have two MVPs. Thus, the top guess integrates multiple traits, with **Willie Mays** as a close match due to military service, MVPs, and consistency.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Jackie Robinson\n2. Willie Mays\n3.

Millon was a college player at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, where he gained honors as a three-time All-American (twice on the first team), leading UMass to three births in the NCAA tournament. After college, he moved to Baltimore and where he played alongside his brother Tony Millon while leading the Mount Washington Wolfpack to several US Club Lacrosse championships. During his time on the Wolfpack, he often relied upon his superior speed and agility to isolate one defenseman before dodging around him to score. This talent was noticed by the US Lacrosse World team coaches which included Millon on two rosters, earning a spot as one of the World’s Best Attackman in 1998, the overall World GamesMVP in the 1994 World Games, as well as being named to the All-World Team in 1994 and 1998. He joined the Baltimore Bayhawks in 2001 and played with them until 2005 when he was traded to the Boston Cannons. He rejoined the Baltimore Bayhawks for the 2006 season, and played one game in the beginning of the 2007 season before announcing he would not play the remainder of the season due to other commitments. Later, in the season he joined the Long Island Lizards organization. He retired again after the 2007 season as the league's all-time leading scorer.

Henry was educated at Helston grammar school, and resided there all his life. Samuel Drew was his intimate friend. On 24 December 1807 he witnessed the wreck of the Anson frigate in Mount's Bay, when over a hundred lives were lost, and this disaster led him to devote his life and patrimony to the discovery of some means for saving lives at shipwrecks. He spent much labour in attempting to devise a lifeboat, but produced no satisfactory results, and turned his attention to the ‘Rocket’ life-saving apparatus, an early form of the Breeches buoy. In addition to this, Trengrouse was dismayed at the then common practice of burying victims of shipwrecks in common graves in unconsecrated ground near the site of the wreck, having seen the dead from the Anson buried in the dunes at Loe Bar.

The legal reform on burial practices suggests advocacy related to shipwrecks, such as the Burial of Drowned Persons Act 1808, which was influenced by public figures after notable incidents. The initial failed watercraft attempt and shift to refining an existing system align with historical figures like those involved with the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) or similar efforts. Sir William Hillary is a strong candidate due to his founding role in the RNLI and advocacy, but he was born later (1771) and from a different background. The coastal town birth and specific accident motivation narrow it to figures like Henry Greathead or others in lifeboat innovation. The burial law reform is key, as it was spurred by incidents like the wreck of the *Aurora* and involved campaigners such as Sir William Hillary or local benefactors.

He was the only son of Johann Theodor Nadorp and Gertrud Anna Stroof. After his education at the Anholt City school, he was joined at age 20 by a fellowship of his country gentlemen Prince Constantin of Salm-Salm in the Academy of Fine Arts, Prague, where he trained as a historical painter with his teacher Joseph Bergler. Nadorp was the favorite pupil of Bergler. In 1822 he received the gold medal of the Academy. When in 1826 his mentor died, Nadorp broke his tents from Prague and returned in 1827 for a few months in his hometown district of Anholt in Isselburg. In the fall of 1827 Nadorp traveled with his companions Prince Franz of Salm-Salm to Rome. The city of Rome drew at the time many German artists, such as Peter Cornelius, Johann Friedrich Overbeck and Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Nadorp was quite fast in the group of German artists, called the \\\"Nazarenes\\\". He was one of the founders of the Roman Künstlerbund (1829) and the German Artists' Union (1845). The years 1840-1850 are among his most fertile. Numerous drawings surviving. During this time, Nadorp met the King Ludwig I of Bavaria, and they both shared a friendship. 1859 Nadorp was received by King Frederick William IV of Prussia, and led to his first government contract. Nadorp left Rome only rarely in the nearly 50 years of local work. In 1862 he returned for a short time back in his hometown.

He believed von Hassell would be receptive to the idea of a pact between Britain and Germany at the outbreak of World War II. The terms of this pact were that Germany would have a free hand in Europe in return for Britain running the rest of the world. However, he unsuccessfully attempted to arrange a meeting with both U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower and British General Bernard Montgomery. Lonsdale-Bryans had the ear of several members of British Parliament, including Lord Halifax, but the level of support of said MPs is unknown. A handwritten note by the MI5 stated: \\\"He went to Italy with the knowledge of the Foreign Office in order to develop his contacts. He greatly exceeded his instructions.\\\" MI5 decided against having him arrested, due to the possible support he was receiving from members of Parliament (potentially including Neville Chamberlain), and the embarrassment this would have caused. Lonsdale-Bryans was on friendly terms with powerful members of the British aristocracy, including the Duke of Buccleuch and Lord Brocket, who also were Nazi sympathizers.

{"text": "Neville Lederle (born 25 September 1938 in Theunissen, Orange Free State) is a former racing driver from South Africa. He participated in two World Championship Formula One Grands Prix, scoring a single championship point. Starting out in Formula One with his Ford-engined Lotus 18 in 1961, he retired from the Rand Grand Prix and only managed 14th in the Cape Grand Prix in January 1962. Later that year, however, he acquired a Lotus 21 with a Climax engine and came fifth in the 1962 Rand Grand Prix and fourth in the Natal Grand Prix. This form led him to a sixth place in the World Championship South African Grand Prix and thus a World Championship point in his first event at that level. In 1963 Lederle broke a leg in practice for the Rand 9 Hours sports car race and missed a large part of the 1964 season whilst recovering. He returned with his Lotus 21 for the end-of-season 1964 Rand Grand Prix where he finished 10th, but he narrowly failed to qualify for January's 1965 South African Grand Prix.

Many articles contain information about Asato, but the relevant parts are clearly based on Funakoshi's descriptions of him. Funakoshi first met Asato when he was a schoolmate of Asato's son; he called Asato \\\"one of Okinawa's greatest experts in the art of karate.\\\" According to Funakoshi, Asato's family belonged to the Tunchi (殿内) class (hereditary town and village chiefs), and held authority in the village of Asato, halfway between Shuri and Naha, and he was not only a master of karate, but also skilled at riding horses, Jigen-ryū kendō (swordsmanship), archery, and an exceptional scholar. In a 1934 article, Funakoshi noted that Asato and Itosu had studied karate together under Sōkon Matsumura. He also related how Asato and Itosu once overcame a group of 20–30 attackers,and how Asato set a trap for troublemakers in his home village. In his 1956 autobiography, Funakoshi recounted several stories about Asato, including: Asato's political astuteness in following the government order to cut off the traditional men's topknot (pp. 13–14); Asato's defeat of Yōrin Kanna, in which the unarmed Asato prevailed despite Kanna being armed with an unblunted blade (pp. 14–15); Asato's demonstration of a single-point punch (ippon-ken; p. 15); and Asato and Itosu's friendly arm-wrestling matches (p. 16).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "MartialArtist", "wiki_name": "Ankō_Asato", "word_count": 256, "label": "Martial Artist", "people": "Ankō Asato", "anonymized_text": "An individual from the 19th century was a prominent practitioner of martial arts in their region.

Lunger was educated in dancing schools in Wilmington, the Holderness School, and Princeton University. He dropped out of Princeton after three years to enlist for service in Vietnam. He was a political science major. At the time he was preparing a thesis on U.S. policy on Southeast Asia. The Gulf of Tonkin Incident refuted much of what Lunger contended in his writing. A former US Marine lieutenant who served in the Vietnam war, his racing career was mostly spent in privateer cars, paid for by his family wealth (Lunger was a scion of the DuPont family). He is also known for helping to rescue Niki Lauda from his burning Ferrari in 1976 at the Nürburgring. Lunger was not raised a car enthusiast. He was brought up to enjoy baseball, hockey, and football. He became interested in auto racing when a friend took him to a race in 1965. By 1966 he was the \\\"rich kid\\\" of the Can-Am series. Between 1972 and 1973 he faced the top competition in European Formula Two, from the likes of Emerson Fittipaldi, Ronnie Peterson, and Jean-Pierre Jarier.

{"text": "Adlai Ewing Stevenson II (February 5, 1900 – July 14, 1965) was an American politician and diplomat, noted for his intellectual demeanor, eloquent public speaking, and promotion of progressive causes in the Democratic Party. He served as the 31st Governor of Illinois, and received the Democratic Party's nomination for president in 1952 even though he had not campaigned in the primaries. John Frederick Martin says party leaders selected him because he was \\\"more moderate on civil rights than Estes Kefauver, yet nonetheless acceptable to labor and urban machines—so a coalition of southern, urban, and labor leaders fell in behind his candidacy in Chicago.\\\" Stevenson was defeated in a landslide by Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower in the 1952 presidential election. In 1956 he was again the Democratic presidential nominee against Eisenhower, but was defeated in an even greater landslide. He sought the Democratic presidential nomination for a third time in the election of 1960, but was defeated by Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. After his election, President Kennedy appointed Stevenson as the United States Ambassador to the United Nations. He served from 1961 to 1965. He died on July 14, 1965, from heart failure (after a heart attack) in London, following a United Nations conference in Switzerland. Following public memorial services in New York City, Washington, DC, and his childhood hometown of Bloomington, Illinois, he was buried in his family's section in Bloomington's Evergreen Cemetery. The prominent historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who served as one of his speechwriters, wrote that Stevenson was a \\\"great creative figure in American politics.

Born in Wontergem, Buysse began racing professionally in 1914, when he entered the Tour de France but did not finish. He resumed his career after World War I, entering but abandoning the Tour again in 1919 but placing third in the Paris–Roubaix classic in 1920. In 1923 he completed the Tour de France and finished in eighth place. In the 1924 and 1925 Tours, he rode with the Italian Automoto team led by Ottavio Bottecchia, where he was perhaps the first domestique in the history of the Tour. He placed third in 1924 and second in 1925. The 1926 Tour was the longest in its history (5,745 km), with 17 stages averaging 338 km. Buysse, racing with his two brothers Jules and Michel, took the yellow jersey from Gustave Van Slembrouck on stage 10 by attacking during a furious storm on the Col d'Aspin in the Pyrenees. He gained almost an hour during the stage over his team leader Bottecchia who then abandoned. Buysse arrived in Paris as the champion despite suffering the loss of his daughter during the race.

The mention of competing with relatives and winning a grueling edition aligns with the 1919 Tour de France, which was notoriously difficult due to wartime conditions and was won by a rider who raced with his brother. This fits the Belgian cyclist Firmin Lambot, who won in 1919 and 1922, but he did not have notable relatives in the race. Alternatively, the Pélissier brothers (Henri, Francis, and Charles) were prominent, but Henri won in 1923 without his brothers as teammates in that victory. The most iconic story is of Ottavio Bottecchia, the first Italian to win the Tour (1924 and 1925), but he did not race with relatives. After cross-referencing historical records, the clue about relatives likely refers to the French cyclist Lucien Petit-Breton (born Lucien Mazan), but he won earlier (1907-1908) and died in WWI. Re-evaluating, the description best matches the 1919 Tour winner Firmin Lambot in terms of grueling conditions, but the relative aspect is weak. Considering riders who competed with family: Jean Alavoine (brother-in-law was a cyclist) or the Trueba brothers (Spanish, later era). However, the most fitting is Philippe Thys, a Belgian who won the Tour de France three times (1913, 1914, 1920) and sometimes worked as a domestique, but no notable relatives.

The flag bearer honor indicates national prominence. The sequence of winning an initial match, facing equipment problems, and losing a close rematch in the later stages suggests a knockout tournament format, common in Olympic combat sports.\n\n- **Deduction**:\n  This strongly aligns with a taekwondo athlete from Central America, given the specifics of equipment issues (e.g., electronic scoring gear failures) and the family connection. Central American countries with notable taekwondo traditions include Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras. The mid-2000s event is likely the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where several Central American athletes competed in taekwondo. The family member clue points to the López family of Guatemala (e.g., Erick López and his sister), but Erick was born in 1990, so too young. Alternatively, the Araya family of Costa Rica in shooting, but that doesn't match the match-based sport. Re-evaluating, the description fits **Andrea Paoli**, a Lebanese-Costa Rican taekwondo athlete, but she's not Central American-born. Closer fit is **Heidi María Johanna Zeller**, a Costa Rican swimmer, but no equipment issues. The most plausible is a Guatemalan taekwondo athlete like **Heidy Juárez**, but she was born in 1996. Given the constraints, the top match is **Gabriela Traña**, a Costa Rican long-distance runner, but no matches. Reconsidering, the \"equipment issues\" and \"matches\" strongly point to **Juan Miguel Rodríguez**, a Cuban shooter, but Cuba is Caribbean, not Central America. Narrowing to Central American combat sports athletes in the 2008 Olympics, the best fit is **Erick Barrondo**, a Guatemalan racewalker, but no matches. The clue \"family member\" and \"equipment issues\" is distinctive for the **López family** in taekwondo, but they are from the USA. After cross-referencing Central American flag bearers and combat sports participants in the 2008 Olympics, the most likely is **Katherine Alvarado**, a Costa Rican swimmer, but no. Actually, the description matches **Sofia Mulanovich**, a Peruvian surfer, but Peru is South America. Final synthesis: The athlete is from Costa Rica or Guatemala, competed in taekwondo at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, had a family member in the sport, and experienced electronic hogu (chest protector) failure, leading to a match restart. This fits **Andrea Paoli** (taekwondo, Costa Rican flag bearer in 2008? Actually, she was Lebanese-Costa Rican and competed in 2000 and 2004). The Costa Rican flag bearer in 2008 was **Allan Segura** (athletics). The Guatemalan flag bearer in 2008 was **Kevin Cordón** (badminton), but badminton doesn't have equipment issues like described. The specific event of a match restart due to equipment issues is documented in the 2008 Olympics taekwondo competition for **Andrea Paoli**? Not finding it. However, **Juan Miguel Rodríguez** is a Cuban shooter, not Central American. Given the evidence, the most consistent profile is a Guatemalan or Costa Rican taekwondo athlete in the 2008 Olympics, with the top guess being **Andrea Paoli** (though born in Lebanon) or a similar athlete like **Heidy Juárez** (but too young). After thorough deduction, the best match is **Erick Barrondo** (Guatemalan racewalker, born 1991, too young) or **Kevin Cordón** (Guatemalan badminton, born 1986, competed 2008, flag bearer? Actually, Guatemalan flag bearer in 2008 was Kevin Cordón? No, it was Ana Sofía Gómez? No, she was in 2012. I recall the 2008 Guatemalan flag bearer was Juan Ignacio Maegli, a sailor). This is challenging, but based on the clues, I'll proceed with the most logical fits from Central American athletes in combat sports at the 2008 Olympics.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Andrea Paoli (Costa Rican taekwondo)\n2. Kevin Cordón (Guatemalan badminton)\n3. Juan Ignacio Maegli (Guatemalan sailor)\n4. Gabriela Traña (Costa Rican athletics)\n5. Erick Barrondo (Guatemalan racewalking)\n6. Heidy Juárez (Guatemalan taekwondo)\n7. Nery Kennedy (Paraguayan athletics) - not Central American\n8.

{"text": "Richard Crawford White (April 29, 1923 – February 18, 1998) was a Democratic politician from El Paso, Texas, who served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1955 to 1959 and in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1965 to 1983. Born in El Paso, Texas, White graduated from Dudley Primary School, El Paso High School, and the Citizens' Military Training Camp at San Antonio, Texas. Subsequently, from 1940 to 1942, he attended the University of Texas at El Paso, then known as Texas Western College. After his second year of college, White began his World War II service from 1942 to 1945 in the United States Marine Corps as a rifleman and Japanese-English interpreter in the Pacific Theater. As a result of injuries suffered, he was awarded the Purple Heart. Returning to Texas after the war, White received his bachelor's degree in 1946 from the University of Texas at Austin and his J.D. in 1949 from the University of Texas School of Law. He was admitted to the Texas state bar in 1949 and returned to El Paso to begin his legal career. He served two-year terms in the Texas House of Representatives, having been elected in 1954 and 1956. He was the El Paso County Democratic chairman from 1963 to 1965. He was elected to the historic Eighty-ninth Congress as part of the national 1964 Democratic surge linked to U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson's crushing defeat of Republican U.S. Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona. White, who received more votes than Johnson did in the 16th District, played his part by unseating freshman Republican Ed Foreman of Odessa in the 16th Congressional District. During his first term, White represented a monstrous district stretching from El Paso all the way to the Permian Basin—a distance of over 42,000 square miles. However, after Texas' congressional map was thrown out in Wesberry v. Sanders, his district was cut down to El Paso and a few inner-ring suburbs. He was reelected eight times from this district with almost no difficulty. As a U.S. representative, White developed a reputation as a moderate Democrat. He also chaired the Democratic Research Organization, a group within the party that distributed information from the leadership relevant to pending votes. Having Fort Bliss in the 16th Congressional District made White a natural choice for his place on the House Armed Services Committee. There he chaired the Military Personnel Subcommittee and was also instrumental in reorganization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He also served for a while on the Interior, Post Office & Civil Service, and Science & Technology committees. Choosing not to run again in 1982, White returned to his hometown of El Paso to resume his law practice. White was married twice. His first marriage in 1949 to Katherine Huffman produced three sons, Rodrick, Richard, and Raymond. After her death in 1972, White married the former Kathleen Fitzgerald in 1973. The second marriage produced one daughter, Bonnie, two sons, Sean and Brian, and one step-son, Kenneth. White died on February 18, 1998.

{"text": "Walter J. Lubken (1882–1960) was an official photographer for the United States Reclamation Service (USRS) from 1903 to 1917. During these years, Lubken took thousands of photographs documenting the Reclamation Service's irrigation projects across the American West. He recorded the progress of construction projects as well as USRS machinery and personnel. The agency also asked Lubken to photograph nearby towns and farms for a series of articles designed to promote settlement on land reclaimed from the desert through irrigation. Traveling with his large camera and glass-plate negatives, he documented 25 projects in 17 Western States. After leaving the Reclamation Service in 1917, Lubken left professional photography until the 1930s, when he photographed the building of Boulder Dam. Lubken's photographs capture both engineering feats and everyday life in the early 20th-century West. His optimistic images impress the viewer with the technological and social advances made by westerners. They make the point that progress and community had come to isolated, formerly barren places, and that abundant opportunities awaited those willing to move west and work hard on the reclaimed land. Walter was born Walter John Lubken, the fourth of six children on 24 August 1882 in Boise, Idaho, to George Lubken, a German baker from New York City, and Hellena Aldelmann. He married Alice Cornelia (Hoagland) Hall, a divorcee, the daughter of John Aaron Hoagland (1861–1929) and Harriet Maria Louditt Rupp (1862–1949), of LDS Church fame, on 4 December 1911 in Boise, Ada, Idaho. They had no children, but Walter did assist in the raising of Alice's only child by her former marriage to Alva Archer Hall (1877–1942). After photography, Walter went back to a former career working as a dry goods store clerk, which profession he apparently was more proud of than his short stint with fame as the \\\"Government Photographer,\\\" and died quietly in his home town of Boise some time in June 1960 at the age of 77 according to the 1 July 1960 AP Wire.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Walter_Lubken", "word_count": 327, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Walter Lubken", "anonymized_text": "An individual (1882–1960) worked as a photographer for a federal agency in the early 20th century.

Born in Fredericksburg, Texas, Hirsch became one of the most successful trainers in Thoroughbred horse racing history. He spent part of his formative years working as a groom and jockey at Morris Ranch in Gillespie County, Texas. Hirsch conditioned horses for various owners including George W. Loft, Arthur B. Hancock, the infamous Black Sox Scandal gambler, Arnold Rothstein, Morton L. Schwartz, Jane Greer, and Virginia Fair Vanderbilt but is best known for his work with the King Ranch Stable whom he joined in the 1930s and for whom he trained until his death in 1969. Sarazen was the first Champion Max Hirsch trained and said his win over the French Champion Epinard in the third race of the 1924 International Specials was his greatest thrill in racing. A Hall of Fame inductee, Sarazen was the American Horse of the Year in 1924 and 1925. Max Hirsch won the first of his four Belmont Stakes in 1928 with Vito. In 1936, he won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes with Bold Venture and in 1946 captured the U.S. Triple Crown with Bold Venture's son Assault.

He started his professional career in 1953, making the majors in 1959. Over the next seasons, he alternated between teams, playing for the Pirates and that team's farm system. Umbricht was drafted by the Colt .45s in 1962, and became one of the National League's top relief pitchers. Diagnosed with malignant melanoma in his right leg in March 1963, his comeback to baseball following surgery made national headlines and encouraged research on the disease.

She served from 1985 to 1987, the remainder of the term of her husband, Gillis William Long, after his death. Long represented the since disbanded Eighth Congressional District based in central Louisiana about Alexandria. She was the first female veteran elected to Congress, having served as a WAVE in the United States Navy. When she announced her candidacy in 1985, she obtained support from some wives of other U.S. representatives who came into the district to campaign for her. Her principal opponents, whom she easily defeated in the special election, included Republican Clyde C. Holloway, a nurseryman from Forest Hill in southern Rapides Parish, and then State Representative Jock Scott of Alexandria, a Democrat who later switched parties. Long declined to seek a full term as congresswoman in the jungle primary of 1986. Her seat narrowly went Republican in the general election even though the Eighth District was among the most historically Democratic in the nation. Cathy Long resides in Chevy Chase, Maryland. In his autobiography, former lieutenant governor and education superintendent William J. \\\"Bill\\\" Dodd, an astute observer of Louisiana politics for a half century, describes Cathy Long, who compiled a liberal voting record in Congress, as the \\\"perfect political wife.\\\" With her husband, Gillis, Long had two children, George Harrison Long (born October 13, 1954) and Janis Catherine Long (born March 25, 1957).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Politician", "l3": "Congressman", "wiki_name": "Catherine_Small_Long", "word_count": 240, "label": "Congressman", "people": "Catherine Small Long", "anonymized_text": "An individual served a partial term in a national legislative body during the mid-1980s, assuming the position previously held by their spouse.

She had prior military service, making her the first woman with such a background in Congress. She was progressive, did not run for re-election, and received support from spouses of other politicians. The district she represented changed politically after her service.\n\n- **Deduction**: This closely matches the historical context of the 1980s, where several women entered Congress under similar circumstances. The key elements—spousal succession, military service, special election, and progressive stance—point strongly to certain figures, with the most likely being those who served briefly and paved the way for others. The description fits a Democrat from a traditionally Republican district that later shifted.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Sala Burton (California's 5th district, succeeded husband Phillip Burton in 1983 special election, served partial term, did not seek re-election? Correction: She served and was re-elected; this doesn't match \"not seek re-election\" fully, but other clues align—progressive, spousal succession. Re-evaluating.)\n   - Correction: Upon review, Sala Burton served from 1983 until her death in 1987 and was re-elected; she did not \"choose not to seek re-election.\" This reduces likelihood but some clues fit.\n   \n   Let me adjust based on \"not seek re-election\": This points more to someone who served briefly and declined to run again. Possible candidates include:\n   - Beverly Byron (succeeded husband, but not progressive and served multiple terms).\n   - Catherine S. Long (Louisiana, succeeded husband, but no military service).\n   \n   Given the military service clue: \"first member of their gender with prior military service\" – for women in Congress, this was a milestone. Research shows:\n   - The first woman with prior military service in the U.S. House was **Martha Elizabeth Hughes Cannon** (served 1897? No, she was a state senator).\n   - Actually, the first woman veteran in Congress was **Margaret Chase Smith** (House 1940-49, but no spousal succession).\n   - In the 1980s, **Claudine Cmarada**? Not found.\n   - Key figure: **Jean Spencer Ashbrook**? No military.\n   - **Barbara Mikulski**? No military or spousal succession.\n   \n   Re-evaluating: The first woman with military service in the House was **Heather Wilson**? No, she served later (1998+).\n   - Historical record: **Elaine L. Luria** (2019+) is a veteran, but too late.\n   - **Tammy Duckworth** (2013+) is a veteran, but later.\n   - In the 1980s, the first woman veteran in Congress was **Patricia Schroeder**? No, she had no military service.\n   - Actually, **Michele Bachmann**? No.\n   - Research confirms: The first woman veteran in the U.S. House was **Heather Wilson** (R-NM, served 1998-2009), but that's after the 1980s.\n   - So, perhaps the clue is misinterpreted: \"first member of their gender with prior military service to hold such an office\" might refer to a state-level office or specific district, not Congress. But given the context, it could be a minor inaccuracy in the anonymized text.\n\n   Given the constraints, the most plausible is **Sala Burton** (despite re-election), as she fits many clues: succeeded husband (Phillip Burton) in 1983 special election, progressive (Democrat), had two children? Unclear, but possible. Other candidates:\n   - **Catherine S. Long** (D-LA, succeeded husband in 1985 special election, served one term, did not seek re-election, but no military service).\n   - **Beverly Byron** (D-MD, succeeded husband in 1979, served multiple terms, not mid-1980s).\n   - **Jean Spencer Ashbrook** (R-OH, succeeded husband in 1982, served partial term, did not seek re-election, but not progressive and no military service).\n\n   Top guess based on best fit: **Catherine S. Long** (Louisiana's 8th district, special election 1985, served one term, did not run again, district shifted politically later). But she had no military service.\n   - Military service clue might be inaccurate; if so, Long is likely.\n   - If military service is accurate, perhaps **Heather Wilson** is anachronistic, so disregard.\n\n   Final synthesis: The description most closely matches **Catherine S. Long**, with the military service clue possibly misstated or referring to a different context (e.g., she was a teacher, not military). Alternatively, it could be **Sala Burton** with the \"not seek re-election\" clue softened (she died in office, but did run for re-election). Given the evidence, I'll rank based on best overall match.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Catherine S. Long\n2. Sala Burton\n3. Jean Spencer Ashbrook\n4. Beverly Byron\n5. Mary Rose Oakar (no spousal succession)\n6. Barbara Boxer (no spousal succession)\n7. Nancy Pelosi (no spousal succession or military)\n8. Pat Schroeder (no spousal succession)\n9.

An accomplished rider who often exercises his own horses, Chip Woolley has operated a public stable since 1991. Based at Sunland Park Racetrack in Sunland Park, New Mexico, he trains both Quarter Horses and Thoroughbreds for flat racing. In late 2008, the New Mexico racing partnership of Mark Allen (Double Eagle Ranch) and Dr. Leonard Blach (Buena Suerte Equine) turned over a gelding named Mine That Bird to the care of Chip Woolley. The horse had won four straight races in Canada but ran last in the October 25th Breeders' Cup Juvenile in his debut for his new American owners. Making his debut for Woolley on February 28, 2009, Mine That Bird finished second in the Borderland Derby and on March 29 had a fourth-place finish in the Sunland Derby. However, based on his career earnings in graded stakes races, he qualified as one of the twenty Kentucky Derby starters. Trainer Chip Woolley loaded Mine That Bird into a horse trailer attached to 2008 Ford F-450 pickup truck, and drove 1,700 miles over 21 hours from New Mexico to get to the big race.

Morimoto received practical training in sushi and traditional Kaiseki cuisine in Hiroshima, and opened his own restaurant in that city in 1980. Influenced by Western cooking styles, he decided to sell his restaurant in 1985 to travel around the United States. His travels further influenced his fusion style of cuisine. He established himself in New York City and worked in some of Manhattan's prestigious restaurants, including the dining area for Sony Corporation's executive staff and visiting VIPs, the Sony Club, where he was executive chef, and at the exclusive Japanese restaurant Nobu, where he was head chef. While at Nobu he got his start on the Iron Chef television show. Several months after the weekly run of Iron Chef ended in 1999, he left Nobu, eventually opening his own Morimoto restaurant in Philadelphia in 2001.

He participated in 10 Formula One World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on 19 April 1970, and scored no championship points. He also participated in several non-Championship Formula One races. Son of Dr. Soler-Roig, Alex began his career with motorcycles before entering the world car racing, participating in rallies with Fiat and Porsche. His first victories came in 1958 at the Nuvolari trophy in Barcelona and the Rally Catalunya. This allowed him some sponsorship to enter the Monte Carlo Rally. In 1968 raced the 24 Hours of Le Mans with team Porsche driving a 907/6 Langheck and a year later in the 24 Hours of Daytona, where he led his class until his co-driver Rudy Lins had an accident. In the same year he finished 4th in the 12 Hours of Sebring with a Porsche 907. That same year enters the F2 championship driving a Lola, and in 1969 placed seventh in Barcelona Grand Prix in a Lotus F2 from Roy Winckelman Team led by Bernie Ecclestone. Achieved victories in several races with Jochen Rindt on the 6 Hours of Jarama and second in the 1000 km of Buenos Aires. His first race in Formula 1 was at the 1970 Spanish Grand Prix with a Lotus 49. Race organisers limited the race to 16 starters, resulting in Soler-Roig failing to qualify, despite lapping only a tenth of a second slower than Mario Andretti. However, on race morning there was a suggestion that the non-qualifiers might be allowed to start after all, so their cars were placed on the grid, only for the organisers to stick to their original decision, removing Soler-Roig's car from the grid as well as those of Jo Siffert and Andrea de Adamich. He subsequently participated at the Belgian Grand Prix, driving the Lotus 72 that was meant for Jochen Rindt. However, the car was not ready for Friday´s practice and he only managed to complete three laps in Saturday's qualifying, and was therefore not allowed to start the race. His final Formula One outing for the season was another non-qualification at the French Grand Prix in a 49. He won the Spanish GT-Sport Championship that same year. He started the 1971 season driving for the works March team, combining the Formula 1 Championship with the Spanish and German Touring Car Championships with Ford Capri. He won the Spanish Championship and finished fourth in Germany, but failed to finish any races in Formula 1. Soler-Roig joined the Marlboro BRM F1 team for the 1972 season, but after a few races with problems in the car and the team, decided to spend the rest of the year racing the European Touring Car Championship with Ford, getting great results and victories in the 24 Hours of Spa, the 24 Hours of Paul Ricard, the 4 Hours of Zandvoort, 4 Hours of Jarama and the 3 Hours of Montjuich.

Obry then patented his device and sold the rights to Robert Whitehead, who incorporated the mechanism into the Whitehead torpedo. The device consisted of a bronze wheel weighing less than 1.5 pounds that was spun by an air jet.

In the mid-1960s Plumb produced paintings with large fields of a single color; with narrow, strips on the edge of different colors intended to optically enhance the emotional impact of the central, major, and usually intense hue.

{"text": "Jon Hess is an American martial artist, early mixed martial arts competitor and the co-founder of the Scientifically Aggressive Fighting Technology of America, or S.A.F.T.A., a martial art with roots in San Soo Kung Fu. Hess, along with S.A.F.T.A. co-founder Lew Hicks, were students of Jerry Peterson, the founder of S.C.A.R.S. They took their San Soo Kung Fu black belt test together in 1993, and Hicks was chosen by Hess to corner him for the UFC. Hess's mixed martial arts debut came in the Ultimate Fighting Championship 5 tournament, where he defeated Andy Anderson by TKO at one minute twenty-two seconds into the fight. The fight is regarded as one of the dirtiest in UFC history, and Hess was ultimately fined $2,000 for two violations of the rules against eye gouging. Hess has defended his actions, citing that \\\"The UFC billed itself as no rules,\\\" and therefore there were no rules to break. However, despite the marketing slogan, early UFC events did have a limited list of forbidden techniques, though infractions could only result in a fine. After victory over Anderson, Hess withdrew from the tournament with a hand injury. After his appearance in the UFC, Hess struggled to find another fight, despite publicly challenging dominant early UFC competitor Royce Gracie. Hess believes that this is because he was blacklisted by UFC promoter Art Davie  After an attempt to gain public support for a return to the UFC via opinions published in Inside Kung Fu magazine  Hess fought Vitor Belfort at SB 2-SuperBrawl 2, where he lost by KO in 12 seconds. Hess has not fought professionally since this loss, but has stated he took the Belfort fight on short notice, that if he was allowed to come back he would be \\\"world champ\\\", and that Belfort was \\\"on steroids\\\" when he beat him. On April 25, 2010 Hess cornered Team Quest fighter Steven Tobias at Gladiator Challenge where Tobias won his first pro fight. Since 2007, Hess has made several efforts to get into fighting shape and has suffered a number of injuries including breaking three toes and an ankle.

A native of Lunsford, Arkansas, he batted and threw right-handed. He debuted on March 1, 1942, and played his final game on June 14, 1951. In an eight-season career, Wyse posted a 79–70 record with a 3.52 ERA, 362 strikeouts, eight saves, and 1257-2/3 innings in 251 games pitched, 159 as a starter. Wyse suffered a spinal injury that kept him from serving in World War II. As a result, he wore a corset at times to pitch. A control pitcher, Wyse was a sinkerballer and a curve specialist. His most productive season came in 1945, when he helped the Chicago Cubs to win the National League pennant after going 22–10 with a 2.68 ERA. He lost Game Two of the World Series and relieved in Games Six and Seven, becoming the last Cubs pitcher to appear in a World Series game. The same season, he was selected an All-Star and pitched a one-hitter game on April 28 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. His no-hitter was broken up by Bill Salkeld, who singled in the 8th inning with one out. Wyse also pitched in the American League with the Philadelphia Athletics and Washington Senators in part of two seasons. He died in Pryor, Oklahoma, at age 82.

The sport involves significant risk, as evidenced by a teammate's death during competition, which aligns with sports like motorsports, skiing, or water sports. The athlete's success in world championships and major global competitions (likely Olympics or World Cups), along with a national medal record, suggests a high-profile career. The transition between formats and multiple events within the discipline points to versatility. The tragic incident and comeback story are distinctive public narratives.\n\n- **Deduction**:\n  The clues strongly suggest a sport where fatal accidents to teammates occur, such as motorsports (e.g., Formula One, rallying) or winter sports (e.g., skiing). The Mediterranean origin narrows it to countries like Italy, Spain, France, or Greece. The combination of world championships, major global competitions, and a national medal record aligns with figures in sports like sailing, skiing, or motorsports.

Carlos Sainz Sr. is the strongest fit among Mediterranean-born athletes from the 1960s with world titles in multiple events (e.g., Rally Dakar, WRC), though the teammate death incident may refer to broader rally accidents rather than a direct teammate.

However, re-evaluating, **Mona Hatoum** (born 1952) is too young. The most plausible is **William Klein** (1928–2022, died later), but to fit 2015, I'll include artists like **Zao Wou-Ki** (1920–2013). After careful thought, the clues don't perfectly match one figure, so I'll rank based on partial overlaps, with the top guess being a European-born surrealist/visionary artist who died in 2015, such as **Gottfried Helnwein** (born 1948, still alive) – but he doesn't fit.

{"text": "Sir Charles Edward Inglis, OBE, FRS (31 July 1875 – 19 April 1952) was a British civil engineer. The son of a doctor, he was educated at Cheltenham College and won a scholarship to King's College, Cambridge, where he would later forge a career as an academic. Inglis spent a two-year period with the engineering firm run by John Wolfe-Barry before he returned to King's College as a lecturer. Working with Professors James Alfred Ewing and Bertram Hopkinson, he made several important studies into the effects of vibration on structures and defects on the strength of plate steel. Inglis served in the Royal Engineers during the First World War and invented the Inglis Bridge, a reusable steel bridging system – the precursor to the more famous Bailey bridge of the Second World War. In 1916 he was placed in charge of bridge design and supply at the War Office and, with Giffard Le Quesne Martel, pioneered the use of temporary bridges with tanks. Inglis retired from military service in 1919 and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He returned to Cambridge University after the war as a professor and head of the Engineering Department. Under his leadership, the department became the largest in the university and one of the best regarded engineering schools in the world. Inglis retired from the department in 1943. Inglis was associated with the Institution of Naval Architects, Institution of Civil Engineers, Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Institution of Structural Engineers, Institution of Waterworks Engineers and British Waterworks Association; he sat on several of their councils and was elected the Institution of Civil Engineers' president for the 1941–42 session. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society. Inglis sat on the board of inquiry investigating the loss of the airship R101 and was chair of a Ministry of War Transport railway modernisation committee in 1946.

Between 1970 and 1988, Emmrich won 47 German Democratic Republic (GDR) titles (16 singles and 31 in the doubles and mixed). Unfortunately, he entered the tennis scene after the GDR had decided to promote only those sports which were relevant for the Olympics’ medals table. Thus, he was barred from international competitions outside the Eastern bloc countries and had to keep the status as an amateur. However, he gained some points at an ATP tournament in Sofia as GDR functionaries had not noticed that it had become part of the ATP tour. After this tournament, the ATP ranked him number 482—the only entry of a GDR tennis player in the ATP rankings. Martina Navratilova claimed that he could have become a top-ten player in the 1970s. After the German reunification in 1990, Emmrich proved that he could compete on a high international level as he won several titles, i.e. runners-up in the European Championships of the 35+ Seniors (1996), runners-up in the Doubles World Championships in 2003 (50+), European Champion (50+) in 2006.

He worked on the taxonomy of flies in general and particularly of the family Tipulidae (crane flies). Robert Osten-Sacken took an interest in insects at the age of eleven through the influence of Joseph N. Schatiloff, a Russian coleopterist. He developed an early interest in entomology specialising in Diptera and especially the Tipulidae. In 1862 Osten-Sacken published, with assistance from Hermann Loew, “Catalogue of the described Diptera of North America” in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 3. A later edition of this work appeared in 1878, as Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, No. 270. He published many other papers. His work on the Tipulidae included a classification of the family. He also studied insect galls and worked on the Tabanidae. Osten-Sacken corresponded with Hermann Loew, supplying him with specimens, and translated and published Loew's work in the \\\"Monographs of the Diptera of North America\\\", (1862-1873), Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Nos. 6, 171, 219, 256.

The project impressed Hal Hentz of the well-known Atlanta firm of Hentz, Reid, and Adler so much that he hired Vason Jones as draftsman and superintendent of construction, despite his lack of formal training in architecture. In 1948, after a brief period spent designing warships for the U.S. Navy in Savannah, he established his own practice in Albany, where he worked until his death in 1980 . His works include the first renovations to the U.S. Department of State's Diplomatic Reception Rooms from 1965 to 1980, renovations to the White House during the Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter administrations, work at the Mississippi Governor's Mansion, and dozens of neoclassical residential projects.

He became European Junior Champion in 1976/77 and was awarded the International Master title shortly after. In 1980, he received the International Grandmaster title and this heralded the start of a successful playing career in national and international competitions. In his native Czechoslovakia (now the Czech Republic and Slovakia) he became national champion in 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1985. In tournaments, there have been many outright first places, including Esbjerg 1982, Trnava 1983, Alltensteig 1987, Baden-Baden Open 1987, Vienna 1990 and the Parkroyal Surfers (Australia) 2000. At Cienfuegos 1980, Dortmund 1981 and Lugano 1988, he shared first place, and at Hradec Králové in 1981 he was runner-up. In 1987 he drew a match with Kiril Georgiev, the strong Bulgarian grandmaster. At the Chess Olympiad, he has represented first Czechoslovakia and then Slovakia from 1980 onwards, missing out only in 1998. His major triumph occurred in 1982, when a 67.9% score helped the Czechoslovaks win the silver medal, very much against expectation. Oddly, his brilliant performance with the black pieces totally overshadowed his results with white, an unusual outcome at such a high level. In recent years he has spent more time travelling abroad and is an occasional visitor to Australia and the USA. In the US he has attended chess summer camps, promoted his book (Winning The Won Game - 2004 Batsford/Chrysalis, co-authored with Danny Kopec) and played in tournaments.

{"text": "Thomas Alan Johnson (August 24, 1983) is a former starting pitcher in Major League Baseball who played briefly for the Colorado Rockies in the 2011 season. Johnson belongs to a group of ballplayers who at least secured a cup of coffee in the majors. Born in Birmingham, Alabama, Johnson was signed as an undrafted agent by Colorado in 2005 out of Mississippi State University. He was immediately assigned to the rookie level Grand Junction Rockies, where he went 3-2 with a 3.97 earned run average and 78 strikeouts in 79⅓ innings. Johnson gained a promotion to Single-A Asheville Tourists for 2006, and had a 13-5 record with a 4.04 ERA while striking out 123 in 160⅓ innings. He then opened 2007 with High-A Modesto Nuts, where he went 14-7 with a 2.99 ERA and 119 strikeouts in 168⅔ innings. Late in the year, he finished 2-0 with a 0.00 ERA in two starts for Double-A Tulsa Drillers. But Johnson declined in 2008 with Tulsa, where he went 4-14 with a 5.23 ERA in 28 starts, striking out 92 in 175⅔ innings. Even though, he was promoted to Triple-A Colorado Springs Sky Sox in 2009, where he went 10-6 with a 5.66 ERA in 26 games (24 starts), and strike out 76 in 143 innings. Johnson came back with the Sky Sox in 2010, finishing 10-8 with a 5.91 ERA in 28 games (25 starts), and striking out 100 in 141⅔ innings. He then made one start for the Sky Sox in 2011 before being promoted to the Rockies to replace Greg Reynolds. Johnson made his major league pitching debut on April 17, 2011. He was slated to start a game against the Chicago Cubs, and he allowed five runs (four earned) on six hits and three walks in four innings, leaving the game with the score tied, 5–5. The Rockies went on to win the game, 9–5, with Johnson not factoring in the decision. He then was designated for assignment on April 29, and was outrighted off the roster on May 3. Johnson returned to the Sky Sox and finished the year there in undistinguished fashion. He made 26 appearances (23 starts) and finished 5-11 with a 7.43 ERA and 85 strikeouts in 132 innings of work. As a result, he was released and became a minor league free agent. In April 2012, Johnson signed with the Lancaster Barnstormers of the Atlantic League. In 27 games (26 starts) with the Barnstormers, he went 14-6 with a 4.57 ERA, striking out 79 in 138 innings. On March 11, 2013, Johnson re-signed with Lancaster. His most recent appearance was in 2013, when he posted a 1-3 record with a 8.02 ERA in 10 games for Lancaster, including seven starts, striking out 20 while walking 21 in 33⅔ innings of work. In between, Johnson played winter ball with the Tiburones de La Guaira club of the Venezuelan League in the 2009 season.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "BaseballPlayer", "wiki_name": "Alan_Johnson_(baseball)", "word_count": 489, "label": "Baseball Player", "people": "Alan Johnson", "anonymized_text": "An individual born in the 1980s had a brief professional athletic career in a major North American team sport.

On February 15, 2013, the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame announced that Guerin had been elected as one of its 2013 inductees. He served in the Marine Corps Reserve from 1947 to 1954. While a reservist, Guerin attended Iona College from 1950 to 1954 where he scored 1,375 points in 67 games playing for coach Jim McDermott. After graduation, Guerin served on active duty at Marine Corps Schools, Quantico, Virginia for two years. The Knicks drafted Guerin with the 8th pick in the second round of the 1954 NBA draft while still on active duty. After leaving the Marine Corps, Guerin would begin his professional basketball career in 1956. As a high-scoring point guard in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Richie Guerin was one of the most talented and best-loved players ever to wear a New York Knicks jersey. His feisty on-court style and wisecracking off-court demeanor played well to Madison Square Garden crowds. Guerin was a machinelike scorer, a gifted passer, a smart playmaker, and one of the best rebounding and driving guards of his era. He led the Knicks in assists for five consecutive seasons and in scoring three times during his seven full seasons in the Big Apple, and he tallied more than 20 points per game in four consecutive years. The explosive Guerin also set Knicks single-game records for scoring, with 57 points in 1959, and assists, with 21 in 1958. His 57-point game stood as a Knicks record until Carmelo Anthony scored 62 in 2014. A fan and media favorite, Guerin played in six consecutive NBA All-Star Games. As a team, however, New York struggled, reaching the playoffs only once during Guerin's tenure. He was traded to the St. Louis Hawks midway through the 1963–64 season and spent the next eight years as the team's player-coach and then head coach. With St. Louis (and eventually Atlanta), Guerin played alongside such greats as Bob Pettit, Lou Hudson, Lenny Wilkens, and Cliff Hagan.

In 1999 Marples moved to Doncaster Rovers for £12,000, which remains a club record fee received for a Stocksbridge player. Marples impressed so much in his early weeks at the club that he attracted interest from Premier League clubs, with Rovers valuing him at more than £200,000. However, Maples stayed with Rovers and he was part of Doncaster's glory days when they won the Football Conference playoffs and the Division 3 championship in successive seasons from 2003 to 2004. A notable fact is that Maples never scored in a League or Cup match for Doncaster in 170 appearances. He signed for Chester in the summer of 2006 on a free transfer and over the next two years would again fail to find the net in more than 50 first–team appearances.

The career path suggests a player who rose through lower divisions, achieved significant success with a club that gained promotions, and was known for his extremely limited goal-scoring record. The pattern of staying with a club despite top-tier interest and the specific mention of consecutive promotions/championships in early 2000s points to a player from a recently successful Championship/League One club.\n\n- **Deduction**: The most distinctive clue is the remarkable lack of scoring across numerous appearances.

The career trajectory of starting in lower tiers, achieving promotions, and the specific timeline narrows this to English footballers who played for clubs that gained consecutive promotions around 2000-2004.

Hardy graduated from the University of Texas at Austin with a degree in business administration. Selected in the 23rd round of the 1970 amateur draft by the San Diego Padres, he reached Major League Baseball with the 1974 Padres, appearing in 76 games as a rookie, all but one of them as a relief pitcher, winning nine games, saving two, and losing four. He would appear in only 18 more MLB games in 1975–1976, with the Padres and Houston Astros, and spend the rest of his playing career at the Triple-A level of minor league baseball. In his MLB career, he posted a career earned run average of 5.29 in 94 games to accompany his 9–4 (.692) record. Hardy's coaching career began in 1978 as the pitching coach of the Charleston Charlies of the Triple-A International League, then Houston's top farm club. He switched to the Toronto Blue Jays' system in 1980 and served as a manager at the Double-A level as well as a minor league instructor.

His uncle, Jean Dubois, had served as a chef for General Bertrand. In 1840 Urbain Dubois moved to Paris but then in around 1845 he left the capital to travel. He worked as a chef in several countries in central Europe before becoming chef to Prince Alexey Orlov, an ambassador for Nicholas I of Russia. In 1860 he became chef in Berlin to the Prince regent, William of Prussia, who would become king in the following year. In 1870, at the start of the Franco-Prussian War, Dubois returned for a short period to France but after the peace treaty was signed in March 1871 he resumed his position with the Hohenzollern family. He shared the position of head chef with his compatriot, Émile Bernard, with each being responsible for the cooking on alternate months. This arrangement gave Dubois time for writing. He remained in Berlin until 1880. Dubois married Marie-Virginie-Louise Boder on 30 December 1868 in Potsdam. They had five children: Joseph-Émile, Albert-Félix, Ernest-Eugène, Julie-Marguerite and Jeannette-Hélène. The two eldest children were born before the marriage.

De Graffenried began his racing career in 1936, driving his own Maserati voiturette. Some of his most memorable results came at his home track: the challenging, cobbled, street circuit at Bremgarten near Bern. He won the 1949 British Grand Prix, a year before the FIA World Championship began. In that inaugural year de Graffenried contested five of the season's seven races, with mixed results. He continued to drive in occasional races over the next six years, with his best finish being fourth place at the 1953 Belgian Grand Prix. Following his retirement from racing, de Graffenried managed his car dealership in Lausanne, featuring Alfa Romeo, Rolls-Royce and Ferrari automobiles. He also acted as stunt double for Kirk Douglas during the filming of The Racers. Later, he became a common figure at Formula One events during the 1970s and 1980s as the corporate ambassador for Phillip Morris' Marlboro cigarette brand. In recognition of his win at the first British Grand Prix, de Graffenried made his last appearance at the wheel of a racing car during the 1998 celebrations of Silverstone's 50th anniversary at age 84.

For over the last twenty years, he has served as a consultant and expert witness to attorneys who represent parties involved in bicycle accident litigation. Shapiro began his competitive cycling career at the age of thirteen. During his career as both a top amateur and professional racer, Shapiro competed in many countries throughout the world. Shapiro was a member of the American Olympic Team in 1980, but was not able to participate due to United States participation in the 1980 Summer Olympics boycott. He was a member of the 1984 American Olympic team. In 1980, he received a Congressional Gold Medal at the White House due to the 1980 Olympic Boycott. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress, and this corrective measure was long overdue given the sacrifice by the American Olympic team. The medals awarded to members of the 1980 team hold the same standing as the ones awarded to such luminaries as George Washington, who was so honored on March 25, 1776. In 1984 Shapiro won American's top cycling stage race, the Coors Classic - riding for the 7-Eleven racing team. The following year, in 1985, Doug Shapiro became just the third American to compete and finish the Tour de France (achieving 74th place), in addition to finishing third in the 1985 Coors Classic. In 1997, Shapiro was inducted into the Cycling Hall of Fame as part of the 7-Eleven Cycling Team that competed in the 1986 Tour de France. In 1999 he was inducted into the Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. From 1985 to 1989, Shapiro competed on professional cycling teams. In 1985, Shapiro rode with Jan Raas and Joop Zoetemelk on the Kwantum Hallen Team. Shapiro built his reputation as a hill climber and sprinter and earned the nickname \\\"Bullet.” After breaking his hip and being advised to retire, Shapiro had an additional successful season before retiring in 1989. In 1990, Shapiro acted as the technical advisor and technical writer for the video \\\"Cycling for Success,” produced by the 7-Eleven Bike team. The video was the first of its kind to offer cycling safety tips and techniques. It was created for all levels of cyclists, from the serious racer to amateur enthusiast.

{"text": "Robert Henry Widmer (May 17, 1916 – June 20, 2011) was an American aeronautical engineer who specialized in designing aircraft for the military. He spent his career working for Convair which became General Dynamics, then Lockheed, and then Lockheed Martin. His feisty personality and at times insubordinate attitude at one time led company leaders to strongly consider firing him. However, his brilliance at envisioning and designing desirable aircraft years before there was even a market for them led to his appointment as Vice President for science and engineering for all of General Dynamics. Born in Hawthorne, New Jersey, Widmer earned degrees from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the California Institute of Technology. He began his career working for the California division of Convair, initially as a designer of marine aircraft. He eventually joined the company's main branch in Fort Worth, Texas, where he notably designed the Convair B-58 Hustler which was the first United States Air Force's bomber capable of Mach 2. He went on to lead the design teams for the General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark and the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon. In 1983 he was awarded the Reed Aeronautics Award by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics. In 1962, he was awarded the Spirit of St. Louis Medal by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers for his work in aeronautics. In 2007, he was inducted into the Rensselaer Alumni Hall of Fame.

After entering the premier tier of their profession in the early part of their career with an initial group, they later joined a different major entity, first in a supporting capacity before assuming a primary role. Following a phase with moderate accomplishments, they attained their first significant achievement in the latter part of that decade. They proceeded to secure multiple successes in a single competitive cycle, earning the top honor, and replicated this championship outcome the subsequent year. After placing second overall to a distinguished competitor and achieving further successes, they paused their active involvement before concluding their career in the early 21st century.

{"text": "Alfred John Sutton Pippard MBE FRS (6 April 1891 – 2 November 1969) was a British civil engineer and academic. Pippard was the son of a carpenter and joiner and spent much of his early life helping his father on construction sites. Initially supposed to follow his father into the family business, Pippard instead decided to study for a bachelor's degree in civil engineering at the University of Bristol, supporting himself with an Exhibition award. Pippard worked for a Bristol based consulting engineer and for the Pontypridd and Rhondda Valley Joint Water Board in his early career. He also completed his master's degree during this period. At the start of the First World War Pippard joined the Admiralty Air Department where he studied aircraft stresses. After the war he joined an aeronautical engineering consultancy with many of his colleagues and was involved in accident investigation cases. He gained his Doctorate of Science from Bristol in 1920 and took up the chair in Civil Engineering at University College, Cardiff in 1922. This began a long career in academia at Cardiff, Bristol and Imperial College during which he was responsible for the analysis of the methods used in the design of the R100 and R101 airships. The public enquiry into the latter's crash, which ended British participation in airship development, found no faults with Pippard's work but he withdrew from the field of aeronautical engineering – feeling keenly the loss of several of his friends amongst the 48 dead. During the Second World War Pippard was a member of the Civil Defence Research Committee which met at Princes Risborough and continued his teaching at Imperial College. Pippard was a member of the council of the Institution of Civil Engineers for fifteen years and was their president for the 1958-9 session. During his later career he chaired the fifteen-year investigation into pollution in the Thames tideway the length of which he was criticised for by the press. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1954 and was pro-rector of Imperial college for the next year.

{"text": "James Edward \\\"Sunny Jim\\\" Fitzsimmons (July 23, 1874 – March 11, 1966) was a thoroughbred racehorse trainer. Born in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn in 1874, Fitzsimmons began his career in 1885 working at a racetrack as a stable boy. After nearly ten less-than-successful years as a thoroughbred jockey, he became too heavy for that job and took up the training of horses. He went on to have one of the most successful careers in racing history that spanned seventy years from 1894–1963 and produced 2,275 race wins. Known both as \\\"Sunny Jim\\\" and as \\\"Mr. Fitz\\\", he trained three Kentucky Derby winners, four Preakness Stakes winners, and six Belmont Stakes winners. Included were two U.S. Triple Crown champions, Gallant Fox in 1930 and Omaha in 1935. His total of thirteen Classic wins was tied by D. Wayne Lukas in 2000 and broken by Lukas in 2013. Five times, Fitzsimmons was the season's top money-winning trainer. In 1923 Jim Fitzsimmons took over training at Belair Stud. Following the death of William Woodward, Jr., Belair's owner, in 1955 and the dispersal of its stock, Fitzsimmons continued to train for the Wheatley Stable where he conditioned Preakness winner and 1957 American Horse of the Year Bold Ruler, who sired Secretariat. In recognition of his accomplishments, in 1958 Fitzsimmons was inducted in the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame. The National Turf Writers Association created an award in his name called the \\\"Mr. Fitz Award\\\" to honor a member of the horse racing fraternity each year.

Hampton enrolled in the Bellevue Hospital Training School for Nurses in 1881 and graduated in 1883. After graduation, she briefly worked as a nurse in New York and later went to work in Rome at St. Paul's House. Here, she worked for a hospital that served American and European travelers. Upon returning the United States, she worked as a private duty nurse for the Conover family in New Jersey. In 1886, Hampton went to Chicago and assumed the role of superintendent of Illinois Training School for Nurses at the Cook County Hospital.During her time in Chicago, she implemented reforms, many of which are still followed today. One of her most notable contributions to the system of nursing education was the implementation of a grading policy for nursing students. Students would need to prove their competency in order to receive qualifications. Before Hampton's reforms, nursing had been largely taken up by lower-class women who were unable to hold other jobs.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Scientist", "l3": "Medician", "wiki_name": "Isabel_Hampton_Robb", "word_count": 210, "label": "Medician", "people": "Isabel Hampton Robb", "anonymized_text": "An individual embarked on a professional path in education during their youth.

On October 2, 2001, Robert Stephens, photo editor for the supermarket tabloid publishing company, was admitted to JFK Medical Center, where an initial diagnosis of possible anthrax was made by Dr. Larry Bush, his attending physician. Multiple tests were rapidly conducted by county and state labs, and ultimately by the CDC in Atlanta; meanwhile, Mr. Stevens's condition worsened, and he died October 5. On October 7, Dr. Malecki quarantined the company's building following this suspicious death, citing anthrax as the cause even though some federal and state officials disagreed. Malecki helped start a Healthy Care program, where nurses provide in-home counseling to pregnant women and continued health guidance after the birth. She also helped create a Comprehensive AIDS Program, which provides clinical care, dental care and housing assistance to people with HIV/AIDS. Malecki has received numerous awards in recognition of her contributions to the fields of public health and preventive medicine.

Key elements include the transfer between colleges (not common among top NBA-bound players), an NCAA title, and naturalization abroad, often in Europe.

At sixteen, and holding a scholarship from the Conservatoire de Musique du Quebec, Turini met Vladimir Horowitz. Horowitz was sufficiently impressed to take him on as a student. In 1961, Turini made his American debut at Carnegie Hall. That same year, he performed Schumann's Piano Concerto with the Montreal Symphony under Zubin Mehta, in which Turini was praised for his \\\"passion and power\\\" and \\\"placid sensitivity\\\". Since his exciting US debut in New York's Carnegie Hall on January 24, 1961, he has captivated audiences and critics alike both in North America and abroad. He has been the soloist with many major orchestras including the Chicago, National, Toronto and Montreal Symphonies and in Europe with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, London Philharmonic, BBC Symphony and Leningrad Philharmonic. He later returned to Carnegie Hall in 1964 and 1967. The following year in 1968 his recording of the Hindemith Sonata for Viola and Piano was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Chamber Music Performance. Other nominees include Julian Bream, Jasha Heifetz, and Isaac Stern. He has made three tours of Russia (first Canadian), three tours of South America, and two tours of Japan. His artistry has triumphed in key cities of Europe including Paris, London, Vienna, Brussels, and Amsterdam. In North America his record is equally impressive, with recitals and orchestral engagements in cities such as New York, Chicago. Gramophone, reviewing his 1965 RCA Red Seal recording, lauded Turini as \\\"a pianist of uncommon ability\\\" with a \\\"range of colour...which straightaway marks him out from so many pianists\\\". Turini made his Boston debut in 1969 for the Peabody Mason Concert series, and returned in 1971. He was the first Canadian artist to win a prize at the Queen Elisabeth International Music Competition of Belgium, at the Concorso Pianistico Internazionale Ferruccio Busoni and at the International Competition for Musical Performers in Geneva.In the summer of 1974 he was the featured piano teacher at \\\"Camp de Jeunesse Musicale Orford\\\". Located in beautiful Mount Orford Parc on the heart of the Eastern Townships, Quebec. This summer music camp for boys and girls boasted amazing settings and a concert hall pavilion that was moved there from the Export 67 site to the camp. He performed on stage that summer at the music camp to a sold out audience. He was well liked by staff and students and was a bit of a ladies man.

He was the fourth person in space, counting suborbital voyages of US astronauts Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom. Titov's flight finally proved that humans could live and work in space. He was the first person to orbit the Earth multiple times (a total of 17), to spend more than a day in space, to sleep in orbit and to suffer from space sickness. In fact, he also holds the record for being the first person to vomit in space. He was the first to pilot a spaceship personally and he made the first manual photographs from orbit, thus setting a record for modern space photography. He also was the first person to film the Earth using, for ten minutes, a professional quality Konvas-Avtomat movie camera. A month short of 26 years old at launch, he remains the youngest person to fly in space. In his subsequent life Titov continued to work for the Soviet space program, playing a major role in Spiral project where he trained to become the first pilot of an orbital spaceplane. However, after the death of Yuri Gagarin in a military aircraft accident in 1968 the Soviet government decided it couldn't afford to lose its second cosmonaut, and so Titov's career as test pilot ended.

{"text": "Sir George Cunningham Buchanan (20 April 1865 – 14 April 1940) was a British civil engineer particularly associated with harbour works in Burma, Iraq and Bombay, during the early years of the 20th century. Buchanan first came to prominence in 1905 when he collaborated with Patrick Meik on designs for the Rangoon River training works in Burma; Meik was consulting engineer and Buchanan was chief engineer. The project reclaimed some 1.2 km² of land behind a wall of rubble 2 miles (3.2 km) long and 230 feet (70 m) wide. At the start of the First World War in 1914, Buchanan was working in India, until called to support the British Mesopotamian Expeditionary Force at Basra in Mesopotamia (now part of modern-day Iraq) with advice on improving shipping channels into the port. After many delays, he was finally able to design and supervise construction of a line of wharves complete with cranes, sheds, roads and railway lines. In 1917, Buchanan was promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was knighted. However, he had already distanced himself from his compatriots by his reputation for egotism and outspokenness, and jealousy of his enormous salary as Director-General of Port Administration and River Conservancy. His military counterpart, General MacMunn, wrote that he: \\\"irritated everyone who came across him or worked for him\\\". Buchanan later wrote a critical book about the military campaign and his own part in turning it around, The Tragedy of Mesopotamia (1938). Buchanan was a member of the Indian Munitions Board from 1917 – 1919. In 1920, working with Patrick’s brother Charles Meik in a firm renamed CS Meik and Buchanan in 1920, Buchanan was invited to Bombay to investigate a potential land reclamation project, the Bombay Backbay reclamation. The costs of the huge and ambitious scheme, and the time it would take to complete, soon escalated out of control, and a subsequent enquiry blamed Sir George (the project became known as Lloyd’s Folly, after Sir George Lloyd, then governor of Bombay). At the same time, Sir George Buchanan was alleged to have “criticised and condemned the proposals of another engineer and had offered his services uninvited” – an action which saw him expelled from the British Institution of Civil Engineers. His later career was largely focused overseas, notably in Australia where he prepared an influential report on the country's ports in 1926 at the request of the Federal Government. His ignominious departure from UK engineering circles meant that the name 'Buchanan' had to be deleted from the company name in 1923 when the firm became CS Meik and Halcrow (William Halcrow had been a partner in the firm from the previous year and went on to take a more controlling interest in what became the Halcrow Group).

The career timeline (late 1950s–early 1960s), team loyalty, and moderate success suggest a player in leagues like the NBA or NFL. The post-career shift to recreational sports management indicates ongoing involvement in athletics, possibly in community or park district roles. The death in 2013 at age 77 narrows the pool to athletes from that generation with similar life paths.\n\n- **Deduction**: Given the clues, this aligns best with professional basketball or football players from the late 1950s–1960s era. The Midwestern birth, height, and career length point strongly to the NBA, as many players from that time had post-career roles in recreation. The team transfer and moderate success suggest a journeyman rather than a superstar. After cross-referencing databases of athletes born in 1936 who died in 2013, the profile fits several NBA players, with the most likely being those who played for a single prominent team before a transfer and later worked in recreation management.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1.

{"text": "Voris was the professional name of Voris Marker, an American designer of suede sportswear who won the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1942 for her work. As Voris Marker, she also worked as a sculptor. Born Voris Linthacum in Baker City, Oregon according to her marriage certificate, but growing up on a ranch near Billings, Montana, Voris worked as a copy-writer for an advertising agency in Chicago after finishing school in Montana. While in Chicago, she had to have an operation on her leg, which led to her returning home as an invalid. Whilst recuperating, Voris came across a piece of soft chamois leather, which inspired her to use it to make up clothing. She made a golf skirt for a Spokane woman to wear in a tournament. Other players and spectators noticed the skirt, and asked Voris to make them leather garments too. She founded her business, Suedes by Voris, in 1933, and by 1940, had shops in Hollywood (where she sold garments to many actors) and across the South West, selling a wide range of clothing entirely made in suede. Her range included day and evening wear, hats, jewelry, and men's jackets, shirts, and ties, made in a wide range of colors. One noted design was a gold-plated evening jacket. When the couturier Elsa Schiaparelli visited Neiman Marcus and was invited to choose any one thing she wanted from the store; she chose a Voris coat as \\\"the most distinctive fashion she had ever seen by an American designer.\\\" It has been suggested that this inspired the decision to award Voris the Neiman Marcus Fashion Award in 1942. Voris later gave up the business to dedicate herself to sculpting. Following her receipt of the Neiman Marcus award, she was commissioned to create a bronze portrait of Herbert Marcus, the co-founder of the store. She made a memorial bust of Gary Cooper for the Friars Club of Beverly Hills in 1961. On 29 November 1936, Voris married Clifford H. Marker (1899–1987) who went on to become President of the Board of Water and Power Commissioners in the early 1960s.

{"text": "Maria Anna Barbara or Babette Ployer (2 September 1765 – before April 1811) was an Austrian piano and composition pupil of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, for whom he wrote two piano concertos in 1784, No. 14 KV. 449 and No. 17, KV. 453, which were both premiered at her residence by her in 1784. She was born on 2 September 1765 in Sarmingstein, Austria, and died before April, 1811, in Bresane, Croatia. She was the daughter of Franz Kajetan Ployer, a timber-merchant and tax collector. After her mother died in 1779 she moved to Vienna to live with her uncle, Court Councillor Gottfried Ignaz von Ployer, the agent of the Salzburg court in Vienna, where she came in contact with Mozart. After her marriage she moved to Kreuz in Croatia, where her spouse Cornelius Bujánovics von Agg-Telek (c1770-1844) had his estate. Both the concertos that Mozart wrote for her are of the highest quality, and the piano parts are testing, suggesting she was highly accomplished both technically and musically.

Jon Stewart (born Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz, November 28, 1962) is an American comedian, writer, producer, director, actor, media critic, and former television host. He was the host of The Daily Show, a satirical news program on Comedy Central from 1999 until 2015. Stewart started as a stand-up comedian, but branched into television as host of Short Attention Span Theater for Comedy Central. He went on to host his own show on MTV, The Jon Stewart Show, and then hosted You Wrote It, You Watch It, also on MTV. He has also had several film roles as an actor, but has done few cinematic projects since becoming the host of The Daily Show in 1999. He was also a writer and co-executive producer of the show. After Stewart joined, The Daily Show steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, and his work won 22 Primetime Emmy Awards. Stewart has gained acclaim as an acerbic, satirical critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular those of the U.S. media networks such as CNN, Fox News Channel, and MSNBC. Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his \\\"fake news\\\" desk. Stewart agrees, saying that neither his show nor his channel purports to be anything other than satire and comedy. In spite of its self-professed entertainment mandate, The Daily Show has been nominated for news and journalism awards. Stewart hosted the 78th and 80th Academy Awards. He is the co-author of America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction, which was one of the best-selling books in the U.S. in 2004, and Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race, released in 2010. Stewart announced on February 10, 2015, during a taping of The Daily Show, that he would leave the show before the end of 2015, but assured fans that he was not retiring and suggested that he would continue writing and may return to stand-up comedy or as a part-time correspondent.

{"text": "Marvin Camras (1916–1995) was an electrical engineer and inventor who was widely influential in the field of magnetic recording. Camras built his first recording device, a wire recorder, in the 1930s for a cousin who was an aspiring singer. Shortly afterwards he discovered that using magnetic tape made the process of splicing and storing recordings easier. Camras's work attracted the notice of his professors at what is now Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) and was offered a position at Armour Research Foundation (which merged with Lewis Institute in 1940 to become IIT) to develop his work. Before and during World War II Camras' early wire recorders were used by the armed forces to train pilots. They were also used for disinformation purposes: battle sounds were recorded and amplified and the recordings placed where the D-Day invasion was not going to take place. This work was kept secret until after the war. In June 1944 he was awarded U.S. Patent 2,351,004, titled \\\"Method and Means of Magnetic Recording\\\". In all, Camras received more than 500 patents, largely in the field of electronic communications. Camras received a bachelor's degree in 1940 and a master's degree in 1942, both in electrical engineering, from IIT. In 1968, the institution awarded him an honorary doctorate. In May 1962 Camras wrote a predictive paper titled \\\"Magnetic recording and reproduction - 2012 A.D.\\\". In his paper Camras predicted the existence of mass-produced portable media players he described as memory packs the size of a package of playing cards holding up to 1020 bits of information. Such devices would not have any mechanically moving parts and would store both sound and movies. He also predicted music and movie downloads, online shopping, access to online encyclopedias and newspapers and the widespread use of online banking transactions. In recognition of his achievements, he received the National Medal of Technology award in 1990.

He has won three Grand Slam titles: the mixed doubles title at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships with Jelena Janković and the men's doubles titles at the 2016 Australian Open and 2016 US Open with Bruno Soares. Murray had an early career partnership with Eric Butorac, winning three titles in 2007. Having split with Butorac at the end of 2007, he subsequently played with 43 partners over the next  5 1⁄2 years; his following seven ATP finals came with six different partners. In 2013, he began a new partnership with John Peers, winning six ATP tournaments, and reaching two Grand Slam men's doubles finals. After the partnership split up, Murray joined with Bruno Soares for the 2016 Tour, the new pair enjoying almost immediate success after winning only their second ATP tournament playing together. This turned out to be a good indicator of more success to come the pair going on to win the Australian Open, US Open and Jamie reaching the world no. 1 doubles ranking. Murray was in the Great Britain team that won the Davis Cup in 2015, the nation's first success in the tournament for 79 years.

The physical description (above-average height, extended reach) and nickname hint at a player known for their wingspan or height, such as \"The Tower\" or similar.\n\n- **Deduction**: This profile strongly suggests a tennis player with multiple Grand Slam titles across different categories (singles, doubles, mixed doubles), involvement in national team success, and a familial connection. The clues align with players like Bob and Mike Bryan (doubles specialists, but they don't fit the coed category or national team award as clearly), or more versatile champions like Martina Hingis, Serena Williams, or Novak Djokovic, but the specific details of three premier honors in mixed and same-gender categories, national team role, and family tie narrow it down. The physical build and nickname point to someone like John Isner (\"The Tower\") or Ivo Karlović, but they lack the mixed doubles success and family connection. A better fit is a player like Leander Paes (Indian, Davis Cup success, multiple Grand Slam titles in doubles and mixed doubles, but no notable family tie) or someone from the Williams family (Serena or Venus, with Olympic and Fed Cup success, but the coed category is tricky as they haven't won mixed doubles majors). Given the emphasis on three premier honors with different associates, national team award after a drought, and family member, it likely refers to a doubles-focused player like Mike Bryan (but he's American, and the national team success isn't as highlighted). Re-evaluating, the \"premier honors\" could be Olympic medals, Davis Cup, and Grand Slams, but the coed category strongly suggests mixed doubles. Players like Martina Hingis (Swiss, multiple Grand Slam titles in singles, doubles, mixed doubles, Fed Cup success) or Daniel Nestor (Canadian, Davis Cup success after long drought, multiple Grand Slam doubles titles, but no family tie) come close. The family connection is key—e.g., Serena Williams (sister Venus, but her national team success is less emphasized) or Novak Djokovic (no family tie). After cross-referencing, the profile best matches **Mike Bryan** (American, multiple Grand Slam doubles titles with brother Bob and other partners, Olympic gold in mixed doubles, Davis Cup success, nickname \"The Twin\" or related to height, but physical build isn't as highlighted). Alternatively, it could be **Martina Hingis** (Swiss, won Grand Slams in singles, doubles, mixed doubles, Fed Cup success, mother was a tennis coach, but no sibling player).

{"text": "Clarence Edward Heise (August 7, 1907 – May 30, 1999), was a Major League Baseball pitcher who played in 1934 with the St. Louis Cardinals. Heise was originally in the Chicago Cubs organization. In August 1933, Cardinals general manager Branch Rickey called his counterpart with the Cubs, William Veeck, Sr. and offered him two pitchers—Heise and Bill Lee. According to Bill Veeck, one of Rickey's favorite tricks was to offer another team two players and trust that the other team would take the wrong one. In the case of Lee and Heise, Rickey knew that all but one Cubs pitcher was right-handed, and expected the Cubs to take Heise, a left-hander. However, on the advice of chief scout Jack Doyle, the Cubs took Lee. The trade proved to be one of the most lopsided trades of the 1930s, and one of the few instances where Rickey, well known for fleecing other National League teams, got fleeced himself. Heise appeared in only one game during the 1934 season, allowing three hits and three runs in two innings of relief in what would be his only major league action. He was sent back to the minors after the season, and spent the next two years in the Cardinals and Chicago White Sox organizations before retiring. Meanwhile, Lee won 169 games in 14 years, 139 of them with the Cubs. Heise was born in Topeka, Kansas, and died in Winter Park, Florida.

Gary Jones was elected to the National Museum of Racing’s Hall of Fame in 2014. Jones trained 104 stakes-winning horses, including Turkoman, the 1986 Champion Older Male. Jones won 15 meet titles on the Southern California circuit, including four at Santa Anita, where he ranks sixth all time in wins (576) and seventh in stakes victories (72). He set a record with 47 wins at Santa Anita in 1976, surpassing the previous standard of 44 established by his father, Farrell Jones. At Hollywood Park, Jones ranks 13th all time in wins (463) and 10th in stakes victories (58). He also won 17 stakes at Del Mar, including the inaugural Pacific Classic with Hall of Famer Best Pal in 1991. Jones guided Turkoman to victories in the Marlboro Cup, Widener Handicap and Oaklawn Handicap in his 1986 championship season. Jones twice won the signature handicap in California, the Santa Anita Handicap, with Best Pal and Stuka.

She attended California College of Arts and Crafts for a year, studied under Nels Eric Oback, and was critiqued by Alexander Nepote. However, for the most part, Weiss is a self taught artist. She won numerous watercolor awards, as well as exhibiting in the White House Rotating Exhibition Program. She painted her impressions of a space shuttle launch in 1984, under the auspices of the NASA art program. To achieve the specific textural qualities that she felt watercolor lacked, Weiss invented a watercolor technique in which she paints both sides of the paper, turning the paper back and forth while the paint is still wet. That way, the paint from one side transfers to the table and then to the other side of the paper, along with some of the table's texture. This process is continued until an adequate surface has been built up to suggest a subject and composition. In general, she works away from the subject matter, in the studio without sketches or slides, allowing the process of painting to guide the portrayal. She also works in a more traditional manner, foregoing the surface treatment of the paper, and starting directly with a brush and subject.
