{"text": "(For other uses, see Alan Shepard (disambiguation).) Rear Admiral Alan Bartlett \\\"Al\\\" Shepard Jr. (November 18, 1923 – July 21, 1998) was an American naval officer and aviator, test pilot, one of the original NASA Mercury Seven astronauts, and businessman, who in May 1961 made the first manned Mercury flight. Shepard's craft entered space, but did not achieve orbit. He became the second person, and the first American, to travel into space, and the first person to manually control the orientation of his spacecraft. Ten years later, at age 47 and the oldest astronaut in the program, Shepard commanded the Apollo 14 mission (1971), piloting the lander Antares to the most accurate landing of the Apollo missions. He became the fifth and oldest person to walk on the Moon, and the only one of the Mercury Seven to do so. During the mission, he hit two golf balls on the lunar surface. These were his only two space flights, as his flight status was interrupted for five years during the Mercury and Gemini programs by Ménière's disease, an inner-ear disease that was surgically corrected before his Moon flight. Shepard served as Chief of the Astronaut Office from November 1963 to July 1969 (the approximate period of his grounding), and from June 1971 to August 1, 1974 (from his last flight to his retirement). He was promoted to rear admiral on August 25, 1971, the first astronaut to reach that rank. He retired from the United States Navy and NASA in 1974.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Astronaut", "wiki_name": "Alan_Shepard", "word_count": 251, "label": "Astronaut", "people": "Alan Shepard", "anonymized_text": "An individual with a technical background initially engaged in early-stage experimental initiatives within a government-sponsored program.

The symbolic gesture strongly suggests the Apollo program's flag planting on the Moon.\n\n- **Deduction**: The profile fits Apollo mission commanders, particularly those who had medical setbacks in their careers. The most iconic figure matching all clues is James Lovell (Apollo 13 commander who performed symbolic activities, though didn't land), but Neil Armstrong is the strongest match for the \"symbolic gesture\" (first steps/flag). Health interruptions point to astronauts like Alan Shepard (grounded for Ménière's disease) or Thomas Stafford (various issues). The administrative end aligns with many astronauts moving into NASA management.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Neil Armstrong (Apollo 11 commander, symbolic first steps, ended as NASA administrator)\n2.

{"text": "Jules Lucien André Bianchi (3 August 1989 – 17 July 2015) was a French motor racing driver who drove for the Marussia F1 Team in the FIA Formula One World Championship. Bianchi had previously raced in Formula Renault 3.5, GP2 and Formula Three and was a Ferrari Driver Academy member. He entered Formula One as a practice driver in 2012 for Sahara Force India. In 2013, he made his debut driving for Marussia, finishing 15th in his opening race in Australia and ended the season in 19th position without scoring any points. His best result that year was 13th at the Malaysian Grand Prix. In October 2013, the team confirmed that he would drive for the team the following season. In the 2014 season, he scored both his and the Marussia's first points in Formula One at the Monaco Grand Prix. On 5 October 2014, during the Japanese Grand Prix, Bianchi lost control of his Marussia in very wet conditions and collided with a recovery vehicle, suffering a diffuse axonal injury. He underwent emergency surgery and was placed into an induced coma, and remained comatose until his death on 17 July 2015.
