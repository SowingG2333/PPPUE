They were known for bad luck and were considered a \"curse\" or negative influence when they participated in other events. An expert praised their evaluative skills. They briefly owned a team in their sport. They also achieved a major victory in a different, endurance-based competition.\n\n- **Deduction**:\n  The profile strongly suggests a professional athlete, likely from the United States given the context of \"own competitive organization\" and \"alternative competitive sphere.\" The mention of \"long-duration contest\" and \"first place\" points to a marathon or similar endurance victory. The primary field where they never won the top prize but were highly skilled, combined with a reputation for misfortune and cross-domain influence, aligns with certain legendary sports figures known for \"curses.\" The ownership of a team and evaluative praise from a specialist further narrows it.\n\n  This fits the profile of a baseball player who never won the World Series but was immensely talented, known for bad luck (the \"Curse of the Bambino\" or similar), and who won the Boston Marathon. The \"most proficient assessor\" comment suggests they became a respected scout or executive. The primary candidate is a famous baseball player from the early 20th century who also won the Boston Marathon and owned a team briefly.\n\n  Given these clues, the most likely figure is **Johnny Miles**, a Canadian-born marathoner who won Boston and had ties to baseball, but the specifics better match **Moses \"Fleetwood\" Walker** or **Jimmy Collins**? No—the \"curse\" and evaluative skill point strongly to **Harry Hooper**? Let's reconsider: The description of \"unfavorable circumstances\" and \"influence on other domains\" is a direct reference to the **\"Curse of the Bambino\"** and **Babe Ruth's** impact after being sold from the Boston Red Sox. But Babe Ruth won championships. The player who never won but was affected? It's **Buck O'Neil**? No, he was a scout and never won as a player. The \"alternative competitive sphere\" and \"long-duration contest\" suggest a marathon win, which is rare for a professional ballplayer. The only MLB player to win the Boston Marathon was **John J. Kelley**? No, he was a marathoner, not a ballplayer. Wait—**Ellison \"Tarzan\" Brown** was a marathoner, not a ballplayer. This is tricky.\n\n  The key is the \"most proficient assessor\" and \"operated their own competitive organization\"—this points to a player who became a scout or manager and owned a team. The marathon win is the unique cross-over. The only person who fits all is **Johnny Miles** (Canadian marathoner who played minor league baseball), but he didn't own a team. Perhaps it's **Connie Mack**? He owned the Philadelphia Athletics but wasn't a player known for misfortune. The \"never securing its most prestigious accomplishment\" in main field suggests a player who never won a World Series but was great, and the marathon win is the alternate achievement. The player who fits is **Amby Burfoot**? No, he's a marathoner, not a ballplayer.\n\n  Let's think of a baseball player who won the Boston Marathon: **John J. Kelley** was a marathoner who tried out for baseball but didn't play professionally. The description might be referencing **Bill Rodgers**? No, he was purely a marathoner.\n\n  Perhaps the \"alternative competitive sphere\" is not a marathon but another sport, like golf or racing. The \"long-duration contest\" could be the 24 Hours of Le Mans or a similar endurance race. This opens up possibilities like **Dan Gurney** (racer who also owned a team) or **John Surtees** (F1 and motorcycle champion), but they won top prizes.\n\n  Given the constraints, the most coherent fit is a baseball player from the early 20th century who was part of the Red Sox before the Babe Ruth sale, never won a Series after, was known as a great scout, and won the Boston Marathon. The only one close is **Smoky Joe Wood**, but he didn't win a marathon. **Johnny Miles** remains the best match for the marathon win, and the \"assessor\" role could refer to his later work as a scout.\n\n  After cross-referencing, the figure is likely **Johnny Miles** (Canadian long-distance runner who won Boston Marathon twice and was a respected figure in baseball scouting), but the \"own competitive organization\" is weak. Alternatively, it might be **Ted Williams**? He never won a World Series? No, he did in 1946? Wait, no—the Red Sox didn't win until 2004, so many players never won. But Ted Williams didn't own a team or win a marathon.\n\n  The puzzle is designed for **Johnny Miles** as the primary guess, with other figures who share some traits.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Johnny Miles\n2. Buck O'Neil\n3. Jimmy Collins\n4. Harry Hooper\n5. Tris Speaker\n6. Cy Young\n7. Walter Johnson\n8. Ty Cobb\n9. Rogers Hornsby\n10.

{"text": "Javier Adelmar Zanetti (born 10 August 1973) is an Argentine former footballer. He played most of his career for Serie A club Internazionale, from 1995 to 2014, and served as their captain from 1999, earning him the nickname \\\"Il Capitano\\\" (The Captain). Known for his versatility, he was adept on both the left and right wing, having played on both flanks as a full-back, as well as a winger. He could also play as a defensive midfielder. On retiring, the club retired his number 4 jersey and named him as Vice President. Known as \\\"Pupi\\\" in Argentina, Zanetti was born in Buenos Aires, picking up the nickname \\\"El Tractor\\\" (The Tractor) soon after his move to Italy where his strength, resilience, stamina, and his ability to run past opposing defenders when joining the attack from his right back position earned him reverence. Zanetti won several honours with Inter, including five Serie A and four Coppa Italia titles. The 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on 22 May 2010 was Zanetti's 700th game with Inter, and the team's victory on the night made him the only captain to win a treble with an Italian club. Internationally, he holds the record of the most capped player in the history of the Argentine national team. He won a silver medal at the 1996 Olympic tournament, and played in five Copa América tournaments, two FIFA Confederations Cups, and two World Cups (1998 and 2002), winning runners-up medals at the 2004 and 2007 Copa América tournaments, and in the 1995 and 2005 Confederations Cups. He holds the record for the highest all-time appearances by a non-Italian born player for an Italian club and his 858 official matches for the club put him first in Inter's all-time appearances list. He holds the most competitive appearances for an outfield-player in football history, with 1123 matches played. Only Rogério Ceni (1257) and Peter Shilton (1362) have played more matches. He is also noted for his charity work, running a foundation to benefit disadvantaged children in Argentina. He has been named an ambassador for the SOS Children's Villages project in Argentina by FIFA, and in 2005, he received the Ambrogino d'Oro award from the City of Milan for his social initiatives.

In 1823, he borrowed the money necessary to establish a paper mill at Fitchburg and served as proprietor of paper manufactures there. His paper mills became the largest in the United States and he built extensive machine shops and foundries in the neighborhood of his mills. In manufacturing white paper he was the first to use cotton waste and also the first to use palm leaf fibre in wall papers. He was elected to the Massachusetts legislature in 1835, where he advocated steam communication with Boston, returned to the legislature in 1842, and obtained a charter for a new railroad between northern Massachusetts and the seaboard, which was completed through his exertions in 1845. He afterward engaged in building the Vermont and Massachusetts, the Troy and Boston, and the Hoosac Tunnel railroads, and in 1847/8 lectured in behalf of the tunnel project. The Science Channel documentary Driven to Invent: Killer Tunnel called Crocker \\\"The Father of Modern Tunneling\\\" for his influence in advancing the use of geologists, explosives, pneumatic tools, boring technology, and said, \\\"He laid down the rules for tunnel construction even to the present day.\\\" He served as president of the Fitchburg Railroad. During the American Civil War, he was a member of the Massachusetts State Senate for two terms.

{"text": "Jacob Christian Hansen Ellehammer (June 14, 1871 – May 20, 1946) was a Danish watchmaker and inventor born in Bakkebølle, Denmark. He is remembered chiefly for his contributions to powered flight. Following the end of his apprenticeship as a watchmaker he moved to Copenhagen where he worked as an electronics mechanic before establishing his own company in 1898. In the beginning he produced cigarette machines, beverage machines and other electronic machinery. In 1904 he produced his first motorcycle, the Elleham motorcycle. In 1903–1904 Jacob Ellehammer used his experience constructing motorcycles to build the world's first air-cooled radial engine, a three-cylinder engine which he used as the basis for a more powerful five-cylinder model in 1907. This was installed in his triplane and made a number of short free-flight hops as mentioned below. In 1905, he constructed a monoplane, and in the following year a \\\"semi-biplane\\\". In this latter machine, he made a tethered flight on 12 September 1906. Ellehammer's later inventions included a successful triplane and helicopter. His helicopter was a coaxial machine. A famous photo shows it hovering in 1914, though there is no evidence that it was successful in achieving translational flight. Ellehammer later studied a disc-rotor configuration - a compound helicopter with coaxial blades that extended from the hub for hover, and retracted for high speed vertical flight.

Stephens began his career in racing as his brother's assistant at Royce Martin's Woodvale Farm in Kentucky. However, his career was interrupted during World War II when he served overseas with the United States Army. He resumed his career in racing at war's end and in 1950 succeeded John Nerud as head trainer for Herbert Woolf's Woolford Farm. In 1951 he saddled his first stakes race winner, when Champion Sprinter of 1949 Delegate won the Roseben Handicap at New York City's Belmont Park. Bill Stephens went on to train for the stable owned by Adele L. Rand. For Mrs. Rand, he most notably conditioned Clem whose important wins included three straight over future Hall of Fame inductee, Round Table. Clem did it first in the September 1, 1958 Washington Park Handicap while setting a new track record time. The colt was then shipped all the way to the East Coast of the United States to the Atlantic City Race Course where on September 13 he set another new track record for a mile and three sixteenths on turf in winning the United Nations Handicap while again defeating Round Table. Clem then beat Round Table for the third time in a row on September 27 in the Woodward Stakes. In the latter part of the 1960s, Bill Stephens took over from his brother as the trainer for Harry Guggenheim's Cain Hoy Stable. Among his successful Cain Hoy runners was the 1967 Futurity Stakes winner Captain's Gig who set a new Aqueduct track record. In 1958, en route to the Kentucky Derby the lightly raced colt won the Forerunner Purse at Keeneland then the Stepping Stone Purse at Churchill Downs.

{"text": "John Harvey was a Cornishman whose career started as a blacksmith and engineer at Carnhell Green near Hayle, in west Cornwall. In 1779 he established a foundry and engineering works at Hayle called Harvey & Co. By 1800 the company employed more than 50 people and continued to grow as Harvey worked with many of the great Cornish engineers and entrepreneurs of the day. These included Richard Trevithick, William West, and, more importantly, Arthur Woolf. In 1797, Harvey's daughter, Jane, married Richard Trevithick. Harvey & Co. built up a reputation for world class stationary beam engines designed to pump water out of the deep Cornish tin and copper mines. The Cornish beam engine became world-famous and was exported overseas, and remains the largest type of beam engine ever constructed; the largest of all, with a 144-inch-diameter (3,700 mm) cylinder which powered eight separate beams, was used to drain the Haarlemmermeer in the Netherlands—it is preserved in the Museum De Cruquius. Harvey's also produced a range of products, from hand tools to ocean-going ships including the USS Cornubia. The company was expanded by John's son, Henry, in collaboration with Arthur Woolf, who was the chief engineer. At that time it was the main mining engine foundry in the world, with an international market served through their own port at Foundry Town, Hayle. Harvey's of Hayle reached their peak in the early- to mid-19th century and then, along with the Cornish mining industry in general, suffered a gradual and slow decline.

She played between 1938 and 1959, and was considered a top 20 player, winning the Irish Open (1950), Israel International (1950), Cologne International (1951), Baden-Baden (1951) and Welsh International (1954), and several times the Rio de la Plata Championship. In 1948 she reached quarterfinals at the French Open and won the All England Plate, a tennis competition held at the Wimbledon Championships which consisted of players who were defeated in the first or second rounds of the singles competition. She also won two gold and bronze medals at the 1951 Pan American Games. Mary Terán was persecuted by the military dictatorship which came to power in 1955 because of her sympathy and identification with the Peronist Movement, forcing her into exile in Spain and Uruguay and to retire from tennis at the end of the 1950s, and excluding her from all recognition, by the press and also sport organizations. Until the 1980s, Argentina's tennis was a sport for the upper classes. Mary Terán confronted the leaders of the Argentine Tennis Association, with the goal of promoting tennis among common people. In the early 1980s she organized a campaign to support Guillermo Vilas and help to spread tennis in the country, when the Argentine Tennis Association was campaigning against Vilas. After the return of democracy to Argentina at the end of 1983 she continued to be ignored by the media and the government. A few months later, she committed suicide by jumping from the seventh floor of a building in the city of Mar del Plata, at the age of 66. In 2007 the City of Buenos Aires honoured her by naming the new tennis stadium of the city Estadio Mary Terán de Weiss.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "TennisPlayer", "wiki_name": "Mary_Terán_de_Weiss", "word_count": 331, "label": "Tennis Player", "people": "Mary Terán de Weiss", "anonymized_text": "A female athlete from a South American country was active in her sport during the mid-20th century.

She finished second place to Harold Dieterle. Faison was born in Germany to American parents and raised as a self-described \\\"army brat\\\" in various parts of the United States, including Boston, Massachusetts, and Northern California. She worked briefly as a bartender at Lucky's Lounge in 2001 and had a brief and incredibly unsuccessful stint at the Ritz Carlton Boston Common as the Backlot's Food and Beverage Director later the same year. She attended Cambridge Culinary Institute. {2002,2003} She worked as a busser at Todd English's Bonfire in Boston in 2001. She worked at Perdix on Tremont Street in the South End of Boston in 2003. Perdix was rated as the gems of Boston for the culinary scene earlier that year. Just prior to appearing on Top Chef, Faison was employed as chef de partie under Daniel Boulud at his signature, Michelin Star restaurant in the Wynn Las Vegas and also worked at the Tao restaurant at The Venetian in the same city. After the airing of the final episode of Top Chef in May 2006, Faison took a summer position cooking at the Straight Wharf restaurant in Nantucket, Massachusetts, working under chefs Amanda Lydon and Gabriel Frasca. In 2007, she was executive chef at Todd English's brasserie, Riche, in New Orleans, Louisiana. In May 2007, Faison cohosted a Greek Isles culinary cruise for Olivia, a lesbian lifestyle and travel services company. Faison took part in a single episode cooking competition called 4 Star All Stars which pitted four Top Chef season one contestants (Stephen Asprinio, Dieterle, Faison and David Martin) against four season two contestants (Elia Aboumrad, Ilan Hall, Sam Talbot and Marcel Vigneron). Faison's team scored the winning menu and received a $20,000 donation to the Susan G. Komen for the Cure charity. This episode aired on Bravo on June 6, 2007. Faison also took part in the Top Chef Holiday Special that aired on December 7, 2007, winning the $20,000 prize. Faison returned to Boston, and was Executive Chef at Rocca Kitchen & Bar (500 Harrison Avenue), a once popular neighborhood space on Friday nights, until it closed in December, 2010. Faison returned as a contestant on season 8 of Top Chef, and was eliminated in the sixth episode. Faison finished as runner-up in the Top Chef Duels 2014 competition. Faison is currently owner and head chef of Sweet Cheeks Q, a Texas-style barbecue restaurant in Boston's Fenway District. Opened in the Fall of 2011, it is her first restaurant.

The international background and multiple U.S. regions hint at a diverse upbringing, possibly military or immigrant family, which aligns with contestants like RJ Helton (5th place) or Christina Christian (6th place), but the entrepreneurial success in cultural ventures leans toward figures who leveraged their fame into niche businesses.

{"text": "Michael Paul Trevor Bostwick (born 17 May 1988) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for League One club Peterborough United. Bostwick started his career at Millwall, and played regularly for the club's Under-18 side and reserve team. At the age of 17, he joined Conference National side Crawley Town on work experience during the latter stages of 2005–06 season. On return to Millwall, Bostwick signed a new one-year contract with the club, but was sent back to Crawley Town on loan in August 2006. Bostwick played regularly for Crawley until he was recalled by Millwall in January 2007, and was told he was surplus to requirements at the club. He subsequently signed for Rushden & Diamonds on an 18-month contract, but only played eight games before falling out of favour at Nene Park, and was released by Rushden at the end of the 2006–07 campaign. He joined Ebbsfleet United in August 2007 ahead of the 2007–08 season, playing regularly throughout the campaign, helping Ebbsfleet win the FA Trophy at Wembley Stadium in May 2008. Bostwick rejected a contract offer from Ebbsfleet, and signed for Stevenage just ten days after the FA Trophy success. He was a regular fixture in the club's defence and midfield throughout the season, winning the FA Trophy once more in May 2009. His second season at the club was a successful one, scoring eight goals in all competitions, as well as helping the Hertfordshire side earn promotion to the Football League for the first time in the club's history. The following season, Bostwick played an instrumental part in Stevenage earning back-to-back promotions following their sixth-place finish and subsequent League Two play-off victory in May 2011.

{"text": "Florence Casler (May 30, 1869 – March 15, 1954) was a pioneering female real estate developer, contractor, and partner in the firm Lloyd & Casler, Inc. A native of Canada, Casler married a plumber who opened a plumbing business in Buffalo, New York. Her husband left her behind with two daughters to make his fortune in gold mining. He returned eight years later with only $700, but during those years, Casler had obtained her license as a plumber expert and built a business employing twelve men. In 1921, after her husband died, Casler moved with her daughters to Los Angeles, where she went into business as a builder and developer. In 1931, she recalled, \\\"I put up flat buildings right after the war when no one was risking building anything. I have sixty of them now. Then I had the idea of developing Maple Avenue. My Class A buildings are on Maple -- one for garment manufacturers, one for printing, one for furniture, and they are all full.\\\" Though she joined the real estate development company, Lloyd and Casler, Inc., in 1923, she later went out on her own, preferring to make all decisions herself without partners. Among the buildings she developed is the Textile Center Building, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Upon the opening of the Textile Center Building in 1926, the Los Angeles Times noted that the building was \\\"the outgrowth of an idea born of one of the builders -- Mrs. Frances C. Casler -- who, though only a resident of Los Angeles for ten years, is responsible for the construction of over $7,000,000 worth of property ...\\\" Casler maintained her office at the Textile Center Building during the height of her career. Other buildings developed by Casler include the Allied Crafts Building, the Mac Printing Co. Building, the Bendix Building and the Garment Capitol Building. By 1931, the Los Angeles Times reported that Casler had \\\"eight Class A limit-height buildings to her credit, sixty flat buildings and a vast vision of the future of Los Angeles.\\\" The group Preserve LA has described Casler as \\\"perhaps the only woman involved in heavy construction in Los Angeles at the time.\\\" The Los Angeles Times cautioned the city's businessmen in 1931 not to underestimate \\\"this nice maternal little woman, in a soft green suit, a black and white hat with a feminine white rose beneath its brim.\\\" It also noted: \\\"She seems to be pleasantly unaware what a remarkable little woman she is. She went right along with her plumbing while the babies were coming along and she marvels that there could ever be any discussion as to whether women should try to combine both careers and matrimony. 'I had to,' she laughs, 'so I never thought about it.'\\\" In 2008, the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission recognized Casler as \\\"one of the first women in the early 20th century to head a company in the field of development and construction of high-rise buildings.\\\" She was also appointed head of Peoples Bank of Los Angeles, making her the only female director of a bank in Los Angeles.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Architect", "wiki_name": "Florence_Casler", "word_count": 523, "label": "Architect", "people": "Florence Casler", "anonymized_text": "A woman born in the late 19th century became a prominent figure in property development and construction during the early 20th century.

Anthony Colin Bruce Chapman CBE (19 May 1928 – 16 December 1982) was an influential English design engineer, inventor, and builder in the automotive industry, and founder of Lotus Cars. He studied structural engineering at University College London, joined the University of London Air Squadron and learned to fly. Chapman left UCL without a degree in 1948, resitting his final Mathematics paper in 1949 and obtaining his degree a year late. He briefly joined the Royal Air Force in 1948, being offered a permanent commission but turning this down in favour of a swift return to civilian life. After a couple of false starts Chapman joined the British Aluminium company, using his civil engineering skills to attempt to sell aluminium as a viable structural material for buildings. In 1952 he founded the sports car company Lotus Cars. Chapman initially ran Lotus in his spare time, assisted by a group of enthusiasts. His knowledge of the latest aeronautical engineering techniques would prove vital towards achieving the major automotive technical advances he is remembered for. His design philosophy focused on cars with light weight and fine handling instead of bulking up on horsepower and spring rates, which he famously summarised as \\\"Adding power makes you faster on the straights. Subtracting weight makes you faster everywhere.\\\" Under his direction, Team Lotus won seven Formula One Constructors' titles, six Drivers' Championships, and the Indianapolis 500 in the United States, between 1962 and 1978.

He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History during the 1996–97 season, and is one of four players to have his jersey retired by the Chicago Bulls (the others being Jerry Sloan, Bob Love, and Michael Jordan). He played a key role on both the 1992 Chicago Bulls Championship team and the 1996 Chicago Bulls Championship team which were selected as two of the Top 10 Teams in NBA History. His biography on the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame's website states, \\\"The multidimensional Pippen ran the court like a point guard, attacked the boards like a power forward, and swished the nets like a shooting guard.\\\" During his 17-year career, he played 12 seasons with the Bulls, one with the Houston Rockets and four with the Portland Trail Blazers, making the postseason sixteen straight times. Pippen is also the only player to have won an NBA title and Olympic gold medal in the same year twice (1992, 1996). He was a part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic \\\"Dream Team\\\" which beat its opponents by an average of 44 points. Pippen was also a key figure in the 1996 Olympic team, alongside former Dream Team members Karl Malone, John Stockton, and Charles Barkley as well as newer faces such as Anfernee \\\"Penny\\\" Hardaway and Grant Hill. He wore number 8 during both years. Pippen is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (for his individual career, and as a member of the \\\"Dream Team\\\"), being inducted for both on August 13, 2010. On November 8, 2005, the Chicago Bulls retired his number #33, while his college, University of Central Arkansas, retired his number #33 on January 21, 2010 as well.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "BasketballPlayer", "wiki_name": "Scottie_Pippen", "word_count": 403, "label": "Basketball Player", "people": "Scottie Pippen", "anonymized_text": "An individual from the United States had a distinguished career as a professional athlete in a major team sport.

The athlete played for one primary professional organization for a long time, winning multiple championships and contributing to the sport's global growth. Their adaptability and blend of skills (e.g., playing multiple positions) earned them repeated All-Star selections and MVP honors in that showcase. They consistently reached the playoffs. Notably, they achieved a \"double\" (domestic league title and premier international victory) in the same year twice while representing a storied national team. Their number is retired by both their professional team and their alma mater, and they have multiple Hall of Fame inductions (possibly for individual play and team contributions). This strongly points to soccer (MLS and international tournaments like CONCACAF Champions League) or basketball (NBA and FIBA World Cup/Olympics), but the international component and \"legendary national squad\" suggest a U.S. national team with historic success.\n\n- **Deduction**:\n  The clues align best with soccer, given the emphasis on international profile, domestic/international doubles, and a legendary U.S. national squad (e.g., women's soccer, which has dominated globally). The adaptability, positional versatility, and achievements point to a female soccer star from the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) era of dominance, likely from the 1990s–2010s. Key elements: long tenure with one club (e.g., in NWSL/MLS), multiple World Cup/Olympic wins, NWSL titles, and number retirement by club and college. The \"high-profile annual showcase\" is likely the NWSL All-Star Game or similar, with an MVP award. The unique double—winning a domestic league (NWSL Shield or Championship) and an international trophy (World Cup or Olympics) in the same year, twice—narrows it to USWNT legends who achieved this feat (e.g., 2015 World Cup and NWSL title, 2019 World Cup and NWSL title). Megan Rapinoe fits some clues but hasn't had a long single-club tenure. Julie Foudy and Mia Hamm are legends but predate NWSL. A modern candidate like Carli Lloyd or Christen Press lacks the consistent single-club legacy. The best match is a versatile USWNT star with a long tenure at a club like Portland Thorns FC or Seattle Reign FC, but no one perfectly matches all details (e.g., two domestic/international doubles in the same year is rare). Given the complexity, I'll prioritize USWNT icons with hall of fame inductions, number retirements, and versatility.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Mia Hamm (soccer; number retired by USWNT and UNC; versatile forward; World Cup/Olympic wins; but no long pro club tenure in a single league)\n2.

{"text": "Benjamin Franklin Butler (November 5, 1818 – January 11, 1893), known pejoratively as \\\"Beast\\\" Butler by some contemporaries, was an American lawyer, politician, soldier and businessman from Massachusetts. Born in New Hampshire and raised in Lowell, Massachusetts, Butler is best known as a political major general of the Union Army during the American Civil War, and for his leadership role in the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson. He was a colorful and often controversial figure on the national stage and in the Massachusetts political scene, where he served one term as Governor. Butler, a successful trial lawyer, served in the Massachusetts legislature as an antiwar Democrat and as an officer in the state militia. Early in the Civil War he joined the Union Army, where he was noted for his lack of military skill, and his controversial command of New Orleans, which brought him wide dislike in the South and the \\\"Beast\\\" epithet. He helped create the legal idea of effectively freeing fugitive slaves by designating them as contraband of war in service of military objectives, which led to a political groundswell in the North which included general emancipation and the end of slavery as official war goals. His commands were marred by financial and logistical dealings across enemy lines, some of which probably took place with his knowledge and to his financial benefit. Butler was dismissed from the Union Army after his failures in the First Battle of Fort Fisher, but soon won election to the United States House of Representatives from Massachusetts. As a Radical Republican he opposed President Johnson's Reconstruction agenda, and was the House's lead manager in the Johnson impeachment proceedings. As Chairman of the House Committee on Reconstruction, Butler authored the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and coauthored the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1875. In Massachusetts, Butler was often at odds with more conservative members of the political establishment over matters of both style and substance. Feuds with Republican politicians led to his being denied several nominations for the governorship between 1858 and 1880. Returning to the Democratic fold, he won the governship in the 1882 election with Democratic and Greenback Party support. He ran for President on the Greenback ticket in 1884.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Politician", "l3": "Congressman", "wiki_name": "Benjamin_Butler_(politician)", "word_count": 370, "label": "Congressman", "people": "Benjamin Butler", "anonymized_text": "A prominent figure from a historical period was active in several professional domains.

During the conflict, they joined the national armed forces, where their tactical decisions and administration of a seized population center attracted substantial opposition from that territory and a derogatory label. They contributed to developing a legal framework regarding the status of affected populations, which influenced broader societal changes.

As part of a progressive political coalition, they challenged the executive's post-conflict proposals and directed parliamentary measures to remove that official. While overseeing an important legislative committee, they drafted significant regulatory measures concerning civic safety and co-developed legislation addressing social equity.

He served as captain of the Republic of Ireland national team from March 2006 until his international retirement in August 2016. Keane began his professional career at Wolverhampton Wanderers, scoring twice on his first team debut aged 17. The following season he was the club's leading goalscorer and scored his first international goal for the Republic of Ireland. He changed club frequently between 1999 and 2002, breaking transfer fee records, but his brief spells at Inter Milan and Leeds United were unexceptional. He joined Tottenham Hotspur in 2002 and played there for seven-and-a-half years over two spells and amassed 303 appearances across all competitions, scoring 122 goals. The 2007–08 season was the most fruitful of his career as he set a career record of 23 goals in a season, including a landmark 100th competitive goal and won his first senior honour, the League Cup. Keane moved to Liverpool in July 2008 but he spent only six months at the club before returning to Tottenham, where he was made first team captain. In January 2010, he moved on loan to Scottish Premier League side Celtic for the rest of the season, and spent the second half of the following season loaned to West Ham United.

{"text": "Alejandro José Machado (born April 26, 1982 in Caracas, Venezuela) is a former professional baseball infielder. He is a switch-hitter and throws right-handed. In 2004 Machado hit a combined .306 with 30 stolen bases in a career-high 139 games with the Expos' Single-A Brevard and Double-A Harrisburg clubs. He posted a .399 on-base percentage between the two stops, and tied for the organization lead with his 30 steals, while ranking fourth in batting. Machado also hit five home runs with 45 RBI and 63 walks. Claimed by the Boston Red Sox in Rule V from the Washington Nationals, Machado spent his first season at the Triple-A level with the Pawtucket Red Sox in 2005, being honored with the PawSox Rookie-of-the-Year Award. He was among Pawtucket's most consistent players all season, and finished 10th in the International League with a .300 batting average.

Their career longevity and versatility across disciplines are key characteristics.\n\n- **Deduction**: This profile strongly suggests a driver who competed in both motorsports and cycling (likely the Olympics), given the historical precedent of British drivers like Chris Boardman (though primarily a cyclist) or those who participated in both. The mention of \"exclusive group\" points to very few individuals, with Tour de France winner and Le Mans participant Robert Millar (now known as Philippa York) being Scottish, not English. The most fitting candidates are English drivers who had Olympic cycling participation, such as Chris Boardman (though his primary success was in cycling) or those who raced in F1 and also competed in other sports. However, the description of starting in production vehicles and progressing through regional series suggests a touring car specialist who briefly reached F1. The combination of F1 and Olympic cycling is extremely rare, with no English drivers fitting that profile. Alternatively, the \"international multi-sport event\" could be the Commonwealth Games, which has hosted motorsports in the past (e.g., in 2002). This expands the possibilities to drivers like Jason Plato (though no Commonwealth Games participation) or others who competed in both motorsports and another sport like sailing or athletics at a high level. Given the constraints, the profile may best match a driver like Perry McCarthy (The Stig from Top Gear) who had a diverse career including F1, sports cars, and other disciplines, but no known multi-sport event participation. The clue about the \"exclusive group\" is pivotal and likely refers to the few drivers who have competed in both F1 and the Olympic Games, but no English driver has done so. Thus, the \"premier global racing event\" might be the 24 Hours of Le Mans (which is FIA World Endurance Championship) and the multi-sport event could be the Commonwealth Games, where motorsports has been a demonstration sport. This leads to drivers like Andy Wallace (English, Le Mans winner, but no known multi-sport event) or others. After careful consideration, the profile most closely aligns with drivers who had brief F1 appearances and also competed in other sports, though the specific combination is rare. The top guesses will reflect the most plausible English drivers with diverse careers and potential multi-sport participation.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1.

His creations during his twenty five years as Executive Pastry Chef (1979–2004) at the White House earned him the reputation of a creative genius. Mesnier was born into a family of nine children in the village of Bonnay, France. He first became interested in becoming a chef when he visited his brother's pastry shop in a nearby city and was delighted by the smell of fresh fruit in the kitchen. When he was fourteen, his mother secured an apprenticeship for him at a pastry shop in Besançon. He worked from 6am to 8pm six days a week and in exchange received 300 francs a month, plus room and board, in addition to cooking lessons. Like most young apprentices, Mesnier was only given menial tasks, such as grocery shopping at first to see if he were truly interested in learning the profession. Mesnier stayed on and eventually was taught how to make cakes, croissants, and brioche. He also was first exposed to puff pastry and chocolate molding which laid the groundwork for his future specialties. At 17 he passed his apprenticeship exam and began to look for work that would both enhance his skills and his reputation. Eventually he found his way to Paris, working in a restaurant and pastry shop near the Opéra Garnier. He soon mastered all there was to learn in Paris and on the advice his employer he went to West Germany where techniques were more advanced. Mesnier lived in Hamburg and Hanover and learned how to make cakes, cookies, fondants, and marzipan modeling as well as mastering the German and English languages.

At first, he worked as a notary clerk, then he started cooking, working at his father's and uncle's restaurant. He studied cooking for a year in Vienna and, on his return to Greece worked for various embassies. He became initially known with the magazine Cooking Guide (Odigos Mageirikis) that he began publishing in 1910, which included – in addition to recipes – nutritional advice, international cuisine, cooking news, etc. In 1919, he became manager of hotel \\\"Hermes\\\", while the next year he left for America, where he worked in some of the more expensive restaurants of the world, while also following higher studies in cooking, confectionery and dietetics. In 1920, he published the influential cookbook, Cooking and Patisserie Guide. He returned to Greece in 1932, founded a small cooking and confectionery school and brought out his well known book of recipes, which, being the first complete cookbook in Greek, had over fifteen official reprints during the following decades.

Influenced by French cuisine, he had been the moderniser of Greek cuisine, as, thanks to him the Greek housewives learned of Béchamel sauce, Pirozhki and Bouillabaisse.

{"text": "Masahiko Kobe (born October, 15 1969 in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan) is a chef specializing in Italian cuisine, most notable as the \\\"Iron Chef Italian\\\" on the television series Iron Chef, where he appeared wearing a chef's uniform decorated like the Italian Flag (Red, White, & Green) and holding a tomato. (In some episodes, an apple.) According to the Iron Chef storylines, Kobe was slated to be an Iron Chef in 1993, but was considered too young and immature. To fix this issue, he moved to Italy for about 4 years to train, becoming the fourth Iron Chef upon his arrival home. In reality, Kobe had little to do with the show before he moved to Italy (although he was aware of the show's existence), and was asked to be on Iron Chef near the end of the four years. Originally believing that he would be a challenger, Kobe found out that he was to be an Iron Chef mere days before his departure from Italy. Because of his quick turnaround from culinary apprentice to Iron Chef, Kobe is often considered to be a \\\"junior Iron Chef\\\", having little experience compared to the other Iron Chefs. Kobe, unlike his three fellow chefs, typically rises alone in Kitchen Stadium, many times accompanied by a group of violins. It was also to be noted that challenging chefs who were to face Kobe always had the fact explicitly mentioned during the challenger's bio, something that was rarely done with the other three Iron Chefs. Kobe, known as the \\\"Prince of Pasta\\\", is the only Iron Chef to have lost his opening battle - ironically with pasta as its theme. Out of concern for his apparent time mismanagement during the battle, in subsequent battles he ran to the theme ingredient stand in the opening seconds (compared to his opponents who simply walked) in order for him to gain precious seconds that could be used for cooking. His tenure as an Iron Chef saw him battling in 23 battles, with 15-7-1 record. He is also the only Iron Chef to lose a dessert battle, though he is one of three Iron Chefs to have never lost consecutive battles, nor did he lose against an Italian chef after his opening loss, going 7-0. After Iron Chef, Kobe opened his own restaurant, the Ristorante Massa, in the Ebisu suburb of Tokyo.

Langrebe was from Valparaiso in Porter County, Indiana. He is remembered unfavorably for his famous line at the Watergate hearings: \\\"Don’t confuse me with the facts.\\\" Landgrebe stuck with Richard Nixon until the bitter end. Landgrebe was born in Valparaiso, Indiana in 1916, the son of Edward William Landgrebe and Benna Marie Landgrebe (née Broderman). He attended Wheeler High School near Valparaiso. He married Helen Lucille Field on July 12, 1936. He was elected to the state senate of Indiana in 1959 as a Republican and served there until 1968. In that year, he was elected to represent Indiana's 2nd district in the House of Representatives. On August 5, 1974, Richard Nixon released certain documents revealing his orders to aides to hinder the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigation of the Watergate break-in. When Landgrebe was asked on August 7 about the apparently unanimous support for impeachment of Nixon among his Republican colleagues following this disclosure, he said: \\\"I'm going to stick with my President even if he and I have to be taken out of this building and shot.\\\" The next day, Richard Nixon announced his resignation. A few months later, Landgrebe was shown the door by his constituents. His re-election bid was derailed by Democrat Floyd Fithian. After his defeat, Earl Landgrebe returned to his home in Valparaiso where he owned and managed Landgrebe Motor Transport Inc., a common carrier and freight hauling company. In February 1980, the Machinist Union was on strike at the Union Rolls Corporation in Valparaiso, Indiana. The former congressman personally confronted picketers with a tractor trailer. On February 13 he completed two trips into the Union Rolls plant to pick up and haul away merchandise. Both times, the Union unsuccessfully tried to prevent his entrance into the plant. On a third trip later that day, he was not so fortunate. Union members surrounded the truck. They swung clubs and broke mirrors and shattered glass. Landgrebe was showered with broken glass.

He became homesick and joined Sheffield United. A prolific goalscorer, he had two spells (1975–1978 and 1981–1986) at Sheffield United for whom he scored 171 goals in 293 appearances. Whilst with the Blades, he was the highest scoring player in a division twice, scoring 36 goals (one for Hull City) in Division 4 in 1981–82 and 33 goals in Division 3 in 1983–84. The latter haul earned Edwards his second Adidas Golden Boot award. His debut for United came in a FA Cup Third Round Tie against Leicester City on 3 January 1976 and his League debut came on 28 February 1976 in a Division 1 game against Queens Park Rangers. However, his first goal didn't arrive until the next season in Division 2 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 24 August 1976. In between his time at Bramall Lane he played for Hull City who paid £50,000 for Edwards in 1978. Ian Porterfield bought him back for £100,000 and played him for the first time against Scunthorpe United on 26 September 1981, the 1–0 home victory being the first of a 17-game unbeaten run. Edwards scored his first two goals under Porterfield in a 4–0 win over Crewe Alexandra three days later. He formed an impressive partnership with Bob Hatton, feeding off the distribution of Colin Morris as United ended the season with 19 games without defeat to win the Fourth Division Championship, his 35 goals being a post-war record. His final appearance for United came in a pre-season friendly at Bramall Lane against Spanish club Sevilla FC on 1 August 1986. He began the 1986–87 season at Leeds United after a transfer fee of £125,000 but only managed 9 goals in 51 appearances, although one of those was against Coventry City in the FA Cup semi-final at Hillsborough in 1987. Despite his efforts, Leeds lost the game 3-2. They also missed out on promotion to the First Division weeks later, losing the relegation/promotion playoff final to Charlton Athletic in a replay. Aberdeen secured his services later in 1987 and he returned to Hull City in 1988. He later played for Stockport County, Huddersfield Town and finished his career at Plymouth Argyle in 1990.

{"text": "Chu Guiting (26 July 1892 – 16 February 1977) was a prolific martial artist who studied under the famous local masters, Jiang Yuhe, Yu Bingzhong, and Chen Delu, and went on to influence many different Chinese martial arts schools through his teaching. In 1912, Chu Guiting began to study Xingyiquan (Shape and Mind Boxing) and Baguazhang (Eight Trigram Boxing) under Grandmaster Li Cunyi, who recognized him as his official disciple. At the age of twenty, Chu Guiting left his hometown and traveled extensively throughout China, visiting Beijing and Tianjin, Liaoning in the north, and Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang in the south. In 1921, Chu Guiting studied Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) in Hangzhou under Yang Chengfu – a direct descendent of the style's progenitor, Yang Lu-ch'an. In doing so, he became one of the \\\"Five Tiger Generals\\\". Between 1916 and 1940, Chu Guiting was heavily involved in martial arts in both Jiangsu and Shanghai. During this time he worked with the East China Five Province General's Bodyguards, the Central Chinese Boxing Association, the Zhejiang Province Chinese Boxing Association, the Central Police Officers Association, the Presidential Palace Bodyguards, the National Government's Military Department, and the Jiangsu Public Security Headquarters. He also taught Chinese martial arts privately. In 1928, General Li, General Zhang Zi Jiang, and General Fung Zu Ziang held the first full-contact national competition in Nanjing, China. The purpose was to find the best candidates for teaching positions at the government-sponsored Central Martial Arts Academy. Hundreds of the best Chinese martial artists participated in sanda, weapons, and shuai jiao. After several days, the fighting competitions were halted because too many competitors were seriously injured. Two died. Since the fights were stopped prematurely, 12 martial artists have historically been remembered as \\\"the champion\\\". Chu Guiting was one of them. During the 1950s, Chu Guiting settled in Shanghai and began to teach classes in Waitan Park, Fuxing Park, and the Peoples’ Park. He also taught classes for a wide range of companies including the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Government's Public Security Department, the Shanghai Electric Cable Factory, the Poplar Tree Beach Power Plant, and the Eternal Peace Company. In 1958, Chu Guiting was invited to become the Chinese National Martial Arts Committee's Assistant Director. Following this, he was invited with Wang Ziping and Lu Zhenduo to choreograph a sword dance for the Shanghai Song and Dance Institution, which won a silver medal at the World Youth Festival. In 1956, Chu Guiting, Cai Longyun, Fu Zhongwen, and Zhang Yu were commissioned by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Education Union to condense and simplify Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) into a general system that could be conveniently studied by the masses. Shortly afterwards, Chu Guiting, Gu Liuxin, and Fu Zhongwen were invited to Beijing to formulate the famous Simplified 24 and 28 Step Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist), forms that are still practiced throughout China today. Chu Guiting was a renowned teacher. It was his belief that in order to learn martial arts one must harmonize the body, the breath, and the mind. Many Chinese martial artists trace their lineage back to Chu Guiting, and he taught artists from other styles. For example, he taught Xingyiquan, Baguazhang, and Taijiquan to Chan Yik Yan. In teaching, Chu Guiting paid particular attention to the moral philosophy of Chinese martial arts, and would often say: \\\"With morals much can be achieved, without them nothing can be achieved. Consider, for example, somebody who studies a martial art but does not recognize its moral and philosophical depth. They will soon give it up because they have only ever tasted the skin of the grape and not the fruit that it contains.\\\" Chu Guiting died on 16 February 1977.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "MartialArtist", "wiki_name": "Chu_Guiting", "word_count": 634, "label": "Martial Artist", "people": "Chu Guiting", "anonymized_text": "An individual born in the late 19th century who passed away in the late 20th century was a dedicated practitioner of movement disciplines.

The profile suggests someone deeply involved in the development and standardization of martial arts in 20th century China, particularly associated with the modernization and popularization movements.

The timeline, geographic movement, work with government organizations, participation in early national competitions, development of simplified forms, and philosophical approach all align with several key figures from the Chinese martial arts modernization movement of the 20th century.

He had a long political career spanning local, state, and federal levels, culminating in service in the U.S. Congress. His death in a mid-20th-century transportation accident in his hometown, combined with his segregationist stance, points to a figure active during the civil rights movement (1950s–1960s). The combination of education/legal roles and segregationist views suggests a Southern Democrat.\n\n- **Deduction**: The key distinctive clues are the transportation accident death and segregationist ideology. The most famous segregationist politician who died in a plane crash in his hometown is U.S. Senator Theodore G. Bilbo of Mississippi (died 1947). However, the timeline and details must align—Bilbo was born in 1877, was a lawyer, served in state and federal offices, was heavily involved in education as Mississippi Superintendent of Education, and was an outspoken segregationist. His death due to oral cancer (not a transportation incident) disqualifies him. Re-evaluating, the transportation accident and segregationist focus suggest a figure like U.S. Representative John E. Rankin (died 1960, heart attack) or Senator Allen J. Ellender (died 1972, natural causes), but they don’t match the accident clue. The accident may refer to a car or plane crash; a prominent segregationist who died in a plane crash is U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft (died 1953, cancer—no). Actually, Senator Huey Long (died 1935, assassination) doesn’t fit. The best match is **L. Mendel Rivers**, a South Carolina segregationist Congressman who died in 1970 (heart attack—no). After cross-referencing, the only segregationist federal legislator who died in a transportation accident in his hometown is **U.S. Representative William M. Colmer** of Mississippi (died 1980, natural causes—no). Let’s correct: The description fits **U.S. Senator Pat Harrison** of Mississippi (died 1941, cerebral hemorrhage—no). I realize the transportation accident may be a car crash; for example, **U.S. Senator John L. McClellan** of Arkansas (died 1977, natural causes) doesn’t match. A stronger candidate is **U.S. Representative Olin D. Johnston** of South Carolina (died 1965, heart attack—no). Given the constraints, the most plausible is **Theodore G.

{"text": "Daniëlle Bekkering (born 25 December 1976 in Groningen) is a Dutch marathon speed skater, short track speed skater and cyclist who currently lives in Den Ham (Groningen). Bekkering has several nicknames like Beeks, Daantje and Dikkie Dik. Her sister Eyelien is also a cyclist. Bekkering started her speed skating career aged 9 in 1986. She became Dutch junior short track champion in 1993 and 1994. In 1995 she became 6th at the Dutch senior shorttrack championships and fourth in 1996, which earned her a place in the Dutch team for the World Championships. In 1997 still as a short track speed skater she participated in the Noorder Rondritten, a natural ice speed skating race over 160 kilometres. She finished in third position in the ladies race and said to be totally exhausted after the race. She turned out to be a talented marathon speed skater and switched to that sport to leave the short track behind her and won her first race in 2000. In that same year she also finished in first position at the Dutch allround championships for students. 2001 was her definite breakthrough year as she finished second in the Essent Cup rankings, third on both the Dutch championships in artificial and nature tracks and first in the Three Days of the Greenery, the AGM Marathon in Mora, Sweden, and the Alternative Elfstedentocht in Kuopio, Finland. In 2002 she won both the Essent Cup and the sprint championship of the same cup as well as the Dutch championships on nature ice and two criteriums at the Weissensee in Austria. She finished fourth at the artificial track championships and second in the Greenery. She was second in the 2003 Essent Cup, but won the sprint competition and successfully defended her nature ice national title. She also won her second Three Days of the Greenery title and finished 5th at the Dutch artificial championships. In 2004 she became Dutch nature ice champion again as well as Essent Cup and sprinters competition winner. She finished third at the artificial championships this time, but managed to win 21 matches in total that year, including The Open Canadian Championships and the Alternative Elfstedentocht in Sylvan Lake, Canada. She retained all three of her titles (Essent Cup, sprint competition and nature ice title) in 2005 and finished in second position at the artificial track championships. In the Four Days of the Greenery she finished in second position. In 2006 she's dominating the Essent Cup 2006–07, winning five out of ten races so far. She also won the 2006 Five Days of the Greenery where she won four out of five races. She has been wearing the brussels sprout suit for a record of 12 days so far. As a cyclist she specialises in time trials and finished in 10th position at the Dutch time trial championships in 2001. A year later she reached the fourth spot and in 2005 she became fourth at the Dutch road race championships. In between she won an international road race in Pullheim. In total she did win 5 times the National championships on nature ice (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007) and also two times the National Championships on artificial ice; 2008 (Assen) and 2009 (Heerenveen, together with her now husband Yoeri Lissenberg).Since her last win at the 10 November 2013 she is the all-time record-holder in marathon speedskating with 62 wins on artificial ice.

Twardzik grew up in Middletown, Pennsylvania, and played collegiately at Old Dominion University, where he was a two-time All-American and led the Monarchs to the 1971 NCAA Division II title game. He was drafted by the Trail Blazers in 1972, but elected to play for the Virginia Squires of the ABA. Twardzik played for the Squires for four seasons until the team (and the ABA) came to an end, folding just prior to the ABA-NBA merger in June 1976. After the ABA-NBA merger Twardzik signed with the Blazers (who held his NBA rights). He would be the starting point guard of the Blazers team which won the NBA title in 1977. He played for four seasons total in Portland, and retired at the end of the 1979–80 season because of injury. His jersey number (13) was retired by the team. After his retirement from playing, he began an NBA coaching and front-office career. He served in Portland's front office through 1985, and worked as an assistant coach for the Indiana Pacers from 1986 through 1989.

The emphasis on remote areas, youth education, and environmental collaboration suggests someone like David Attenborough or affiliated artists. However, Attenborough remains alive, so alternatives are considered. The clues fit a wildlife filmmaker or artist who worked with environmentalists and contributed to shows like BBC's natural history series. Death in the 2010s narrows it to figures like Gerald Durrell (died 1995 – too early) or others such as Peter Scott (died 1989 – too early). More likely is a contemporary figure like Nick Park (alive) or a nature presenter. Re-evaluating: \"creative field focusing on natural subjects\" could be a wildlife illustrator or photographer with remote area works exhibited academically. Collaboration with an environmental professional (e.g., a spouse or partner) hints at figures like Jane Goodall's associates, but Goodall is alive. The academic exhibition in early 2000s suggests a university or museum showcase. Death in 2010s points to individuals like Simon King (alive) or filmmakers. A strong candidate is Richard Evans Schultes (American – not UK), so not fitting. Considering UK nature writers: Roger Deakin (died 2006 – too early). For artists: John Busby (wildlife artist, died 2015) fits many clues – UK, nature art, education, exhibitions. Collaboration could be with environmentalists like Peter Scott. Youth media might include BBC's \"The Really Wild Show\" contributors. Top guess: A UK wildlife artist or presenter like David Attenborough's colleagues, but Attenborough himself is excluded due to death clue. Possibly Chris Packham (alive) – no. Dead nature presenters: Terry Nutkins (died 2012) – worked on children's TV like \"The Really Wild Show,\" but not primarily an artist. Better fit: A wildlife illustrator like Keith Brockie (died 2019) – Scottish, nature art, exhibitions, but collaboration? Less clear. Synthesis: The profile most closely matches a UK-based natural history filmmaker or artist who died in the 2010s, with remote area works, educational media for youth, environmental awards, and an academic exhibition.

A UK polar artist like David Rosenthal (alive) – no. Dead: John Beatty (alive). Possibly **Michele Westmorland** (American) – no. \nGiven the death in 2010s and youth education, consider **Terry Nutkins** (died 2012) – UK, naturalist, TV presenter for children's shows like \"The Really Wild Show,\" associated with environmentalist Peter Scott (collaboration), but not primarily an artist. \nAlternatively, **John Hurford** (wildlife artist, died 2019) – but not widely known. \nBetter: **Chris Drury** (alive) – no. \nAfter thorough deduction, the most consistent figure is **Terry Nutkins**, but with artistic representations possibly referring to his TV work.

{"text": "John Henry \\\"Heinie\\\" Sand (July 3, 1897 – November 3, 1958) was an American shortstop in Major League Baseball who played from 1923 to 1928 with the Philadelphia Phillies. He debuted on April 17, 1923 and played his final game on September 30, 1928. In 1925, he had a .364 on-base percentage and 55 runs batted in and was 18th in the voting for the National League's Most Valuable Player Award. Over six season, he played in 848 games, including 772 at shortstop. For his career, he hit for a .258 average with a .343 on-base percentage. Born in San Francisco, California, Sand got his start playing for the Salt Lake City Bees of the Pacific Coast League from 1918 to 1922. Sand had an unassisted triple play while playing for Salt Lake City. Sand is best known for his role in a 1924 bribery incident that resulted in two players being banned from baseball by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Sand knew New York Giants player Jimmy O'Connell from their days in San Francisco. On September 23, the Phillies were out of contention, and O'Connell offered to pay $500 to Sand if he would \\\"go easy\\\" on the Giants. The incident came to the attention of Judge Landis, who conducted a hearing. O'Connell admitted making the offer and implicated Giants coach Cozy Dolan in the scheme. Landis banned both O'Connell and Dolan from baseball. Sand was involved as a shortstop in three triple plays in his career. In July 1924, Sand was involved in a triple play on a ball hit by Heinie Groh. In 1929, Sand was acquired by the Rochester Red Wings of the International League. After playing one year in Rochester, Sand was sold to the Baltimore Orioles in November 1929. Sand played for the Orioles for four years from 1930 to 1933. He finished his career in 1934 playing for San Francisco's Mission Reds in the Pacific Coast League. The statistic that stands out above all others with Sand was his propensity to strike out. He was among the top 10 batters in strikeouts in all six of his major league seasons, striking out 56 times in his rookie season in 1923 (5th highest in the National League (NL)), 57 in 1924 (3rd highest in the NL), 65 in 1925 (2nd highest in the NL), 56 in 1926 (6th highest in the NL), 59 in 1927 (3rd highest in the NL), and 49 in his final season in 1928 (9th highest in the NL). Sand was also a leader in bases on balls, walking 82 times in 1923 (2nd in the NL), 52 times in 1924 (10th in the NL), 64 times in 1925 (6th in the NL), and 66 times in 1926 (2nd in the NL). Sand also was third in runs scored in the National League in 1926, with 99. Sand belongs to that small group of players who always had at least 120 games and 400+ at bats in every major league season played. After retiring from baseball, Sand became involved in the plumbing business. He was a member of one of the oldest plumbing contracting companies in San Francisco.

However, the text specifies *another competitor* attempting to influence a game's outcome and sanctions against *two other figures*, which better fits the 1920 case of Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman, who was killed by a pitch, leading to scrutiny of the New York Yankees and sanctions. But that doesn't match the \"improperly influence\" clue. Alternatively, it could refer to the 1919–1920 aftermath, where players like \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson were banned, but the text describes sanctions against two *other* figures (not the player described), possibly umpires or officials.\n  - The statistical profile—high strikeouts and walks—matches a power hitter or a pitcher with wild control, common in the dead-ball or early live-ball era.\n  - The player's durability and consistent ranking in strikeouts and walks suggest a notable, everyday player.\n  - Post-retirement in trade industry in hometown and death in early 60s at a local medical facility narrows down the location and era.\n\n- **Deduction**:\n  - The clues strongly point to a baseball player from the 1910s–1920s, possibly involved in or adjacent to the Black Sox Scandal. The description of another competitor (likely a player) attempting to influence a game and sanctions against two others could refer to the 1920 controversy surrounding the Chicago White Sox, where players like Eddie Cicotte and Lefty Williams were banned, and others were implicated.\n  - The statistical emphasis on strikeouts and walks fits players like Babe Ruth (who had high strikeouts and walks as a hitter), but Ruth didn't work in trade post-retirement and died at 53, not early 60s. Alternatively, it could be a pitcher like Walter Johnson, but Johnson didn't have high walks as a hitter and died at 59, close to early 60s, but not in a medical facility in his hometown (he died in Washington, D.C., not his birthplace).\n  - Considering the disciplinary matter, the player might be from a team like the Chicago White Sox, New York Giants, or Boston Red Sox, with the \"another competitor\" being someone like Hal Chase (known for game-fixing attempts) and sanctions against figures like umpires or managers.\n  - The post-retirement trade industry and death in early 60s suggest a less famous player who returned to a blue-collar job. Players from that era often did this, e.g., working in manufacturing, sales, or local businesses.\n\n  After cross-referencing, the profile best matches **Shoeless Joe Jackson** (high strikeouts and walks as a hitter, involved in the Black Sox Scandal, but he was banned and didn't enter trade; died at 64 in Greenville, SC, but not in a medical facility). Alternatively, it could be **Eddie Collins** (White Sox, durable, high walks, but not high strikeouts, and he worked in baseball post-retirement). The clues are ambiguous but lean toward a player from the 1910s–1920s with power-hitting or pitching stats, durability, and a post-career trade job.\n\n  Given the emphasis on strikeouts and walks, I'll prioritize players known for these, like **Babe Ruth**, but adjust for the disciplinary clue (Ruth wasn't directly involved in game-fixing) and death age. The most consistent match is **Ray Chapman**, but he died during his career (1920), so not retired. Re-evaluating, the \"disciplinary matter\" might refer to the **1919 Black Sox**, where players like **Buck Weaver** (who maintained innocence) were banned, and he later worked in trade (auto parts) and died at 65 in Chicago hospital. Weaver fits: durable infielder for White Sox, high strikeouts and walks for his position, involved in scandal (other players attempted to fix games, and two officials were sanctioned?), but the \"two other figures\" is unclear—possibly referees? In baseball, it could be umpires or league officials sanctioned in aftermath.\n\n  After thorough analysis, the top guess is **Buck Weaver** for his role in the Black Sox, durability, stats, and post-retirement trade work.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1.

The sport is team-based and involves multi-stage events and international tours—strongly suggesting professional road cycling. Early 1980s successes align with Eastern Bloc national teams dominating amateur competitions like the Olympics or World Championships before the sport fully professionalized. The hiatus for another profession is unusual but documented in some cyclists. Competing for professional teams in different countries and regional successes in the early 1990s fit the post-Soviet transition era where Eastern European athletes joined Western professional teams.\n\n- **Deduction**:\n  This points to a cyclist from the Soviet Union or allied Eastern Bloc countries who was part of the dominant amateur squads in the early 1980s (e.g., Olympic or World Championship team events). The multi-stage victories suggest stage race specialists. The brief career break for another profession is a rare but notable clue—limiting candidates. Early 1990s regional successes likely refer to races in Eastern Europe or Asia as the sport globalized.

Allen was born in a log cabin near Winnfield, the seat of Winn Parish, to Asa L. Allen and the former Sophronia Perkins. He was a younger brother of Governor Oscar Kelly Allen. He was educated in the Winn Parish public schools and received a bachelor's degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge in 1914. The next year, he married the former Lottie Mae Thompson, and they had two sons, Harwell L. Allen, who became a district judge, and Lyndon Blaine Allen. Allen taught in the rural schools of neighboring Grant Parish from 1914 to 1917. He was a principal in schools in Georgetown and Verda near Montgomery. Thereafter, he became the superintendent of the Winn Parish system, 1917-1922. He studied law on his own, was admitted to the bar in 1922, and practiced in Winnfield, where he was city attorney for a time. Allen was a prominent Baptist, who served a stint as vice-president of the Louisiana Baptist Convention. He was a Scottish Rite Mason and a Shriner.

Born in Havana, \\\"Laz\\\" Barrera was one of nine brothers who went on to become involved in thoroughbred horse racing in the United States. While in his teens, he began working at a racetrack in his native Cuba and within a few years was one of the country's most respected young trainers. Seeking increased opportunities in a larger market, in the 1940s Barrera moved to Mexico to race horses at the Hipodromo de las Americas in Mexico City. There, he met California-based trainer Hal King, who encouraged him to come to the United States. Barrera did, and in 1971 trained his first American Stakes race winner. In the ensuing years he built a solid reputation and in late 1975 was given Bold Forbes to train who had been that year's Puerto Rican two-year-old thoroughbred sprint champion. Racing in the U.S. in 1976 under jockey Angel Cordero, Jr., Bold Forbes won several important races for Barrera including the Wood Memorial Stakes in record time. He went on to win the most prestigious race of all, the Kentucky Derby, finished third in the Preakness Stakes and, for a converted sprinter, pulled off a dramatic win in the 1½ mile long Belmont Stakes. Barrera's accomplishments led to an offer from Louis & Patrice Wolfson to take over as head trainer for their Harbor View Farm in Ocala, Marion County, Florida. There, Barrera took charge of a horse named Affirmed who, under 18-year-old jockey Steve Cauthen, would become one of the great horses in American racing history. Affirmed was a two-time Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner and won Eclipse Awards in each of the three years he raced. Laz Barrera won fourteen Grade 1 Stakes races with Affirmed, the most by any stallion in history, and earned racing immortality by capturing the 1978 U.S. Triple Crown, the tenth trainer to sweep the races in a season. Since then, one trainer (D. Wayne Lukas) has won all three of the Triple Crown races, in 1995 when he trained two horses (Thunder Gulch and Timber Country) for the only individual Triple Crown winner, but it would not be until 20 years after Lukas' unique double that Bob Baffert would do the traditional Crown with American Pharoah doing the triple in 2015. In a career that lasted almost fifty years, Laz Barrera trained six champions and more than 140 American Stakes race winners. He was the leading money-winning trainer from 1977 to 1980 and in the process became the only trainer to ever win four consecutive Eclipse Awards. In 1979, he was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

{"text": "Evaristo Baschenis (December 7, 1617 – March 16, 1677) was an Italian Baroque painter of the 17th century, active mainly around his native city of Bergamo. He was born to a family of artists. He is best known for still lifes, most commonly of musical instruments. This could explain his friendship with a family with notable violin makers from Cremona. Still-life depiction were uncommon as a thematic among Italian painters prior to the 17th century. Baschenis, along with the more eccentric 16th century painter Milanese Arcimboldo, represents provincial outputs with idiosyncratic tendencies that appear to appeal to the discernment of forms and shapes rather than grand manner themes of religious or mythologic events. For Arcimboldo, the artifice is everything; for Baschenis, the items, man-made musical instruments, have a purpose and a beauty even in their silent geometry. One source for his photographic style of still life could be Caravaggio's early painting of peaches, or alternatively, Dutch paintings. The most faithful imitator of his style is a younger contemporary Bergamese, Bartolomeo Bettera. Baschenis is a contemporary of the Bergamese portrait artist, Carlo Ceresa, and appears to have been influential for the Modenese artist Cristoforo Munari.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "Evaristo_Baschenis", "word_count": 194, "label": "Painter", "people": "Evaristo Baschenis", "anonymized_text": "An individual from a creative family background, active during a past era in a European region, gained recognition for a specific category of artworks.

This artistic focus was not widely practiced by creators in that cultural sphere before that period. This creator, along with another earlier artist known for unconventional approaches, represented artistic production from outside the main cultural centers that emphasized formal qualities rather than traditional narrative subjects. While the earlier artist prioritized artistic invention, this creator found significance in the inherent qualities of manufactured objects, appreciating their design and potential even in static presentation. Possible influences include certain early realistic works from their region or artistic traditions from northern Europe. Their approach was later adopted by a younger creator from the same area.

Her recipes appear in magazines such as Food & Wine. She is a contributing writer at Flavor and the Menu Magazine. She teaches and has written textbooks including ebooks used to teach students of the culinary arts. She is recognized as an authority on artisan baking, confectionery, cooking food in sealed plastic bags with water or steam called sous vide, and spa cooking techniques. In 2016, Martel is teaching a course in food writing at GateWay Community College in New Haven. Martel married prominent Connecticut restaurateur and chef Charlie van Over, and the couple often collaborate on recipes and cooking. Martel and van Over have cooked for 60 Minutes reporter Morley Safer, Chef Jacques Pepin as well as the late Broadway actor Peter Kapetan at their home in Connecticut. Martel and van Over were co–owners of a restaurant in Chester called Restaurant du Village. Her cooking often reflects a Mediterranean emphasis. She has a particular interest and expertise in almonds and desserts of the northeast. Martel and van Over hold patents regarding baking processes. Martel attended Phillips Academy in Andover and graduated in the school's first co–educational class in 1974. Her classmates included jazz Grammy–winner Bill Cunliffe, software financier Peter Currie, actor Dana Delany, painter Julian Hatton, poet Karl Kirchwey, writer Nate Lee, television producer Jonathan Meath, editor Sara Nelson, and sculptor Gar Waterman. She graduated from Brown University in 1978. Her love of writing was influenced in part after taking a course at Wesleyan called Portraits of People taught by Anne Greene, in the 1980s. Martel and van Over opened a Chester, Connecticut restaurant which they named Restaurant du Village in 1979 and sold it in 1990. In 2010, they own a firm called \\\"All About Food\\\" which holds baking patents and collaborates with food manufacturers and restaurants on such matters as menus, marketing programs, and new products. Martel and van Over were quoted in the New York Times about doing rotisserie cooking using a fireplace; on occasions, Martel and van Over have cooked for fellow Chester resident and 60 Minutes reporter Morley Safer. The couple would cook a multicourse meal in the fireplace while having sing–a–longs which sometimes included dancing, and their dinners often included quail, duck, venison or porterhouse steak. At one point, Martel and van Over lived in a house with six or seven fireplaces. Martel said the fireplace cooking experiences \\\"brings out the best in people.\\\" They grow vegetables and other foods in their garden for some of their meals. The dining table often has beautiful flowers such as zinnias and snapdragons and meals are often served with wine. Martel and van Over advise restaurants about such matters as how to create a brasserie. Beef steak and veal stew are cooked using a Tuscan grill. Martel and van Over argued in their book \\\"The Best Bread Ever\\\" that the best way to make the perfect loaf is to use a food processor. Martel's recipes entitled Cod with creamy nut sauce and Chicken Almond Curry with Apricots appeared in Food & Wine magazine. She is co-author of culinary textbooks On Baking: A Textbook of Baking and Pastry Fundamentals and On Cooking: A Textbook of Culinary Fundamentals.

{"text": "(This is a Catalan name. The first family name is Gaudí and the second is Cornet.) Antoni Gaudí i Cornet (25 June 1852 – 10 June 1926) was a Spanish Catalan architect from Reus and the best known practitioner of Catalan Modernism. Gaudí's works reflect an individualized and distinctive style. Most are located in Barcelona, including his magnum opus, the Sagrada Família. Gaudí's work was influenced by his passions in life: architecture, nature, and religion. Gaudí considered every detail of his creations and integrated into his architecture such crafts as ceramics, stained glass, wrought ironwork forging and carpentry. He also introduced new techniques in the treatment of materials, such as trencadís which used waste ceramic pieces. Under the influence of neo-Gothic art and Oriental techniques, Gaudí became part of the Modernista movement which was reaching its peak in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. His work transcended mainstream Modernisme, culminating in an organic style inspired by natural forms. Gaudí rarely drew detailed plans of his works, instead preferring to create them as three-dimensional scale models and molding the details as he conceived them. Gaudí's work enjoys global popularity and continuing admiration and study by architects. His masterpiece, the still-incomplete Sagrada Família, is the most-visited monument in Spain. Between 1984 and 2005, seven of his works were declared World Heritage Sites by UNESCO. Gaudí's Roman Catholic faith intensified during his life and religious images appear in many of his works.

{"text": "Sir Bradley Marc Wiggins, CBE (born 28 April 1980) is a British professional road and track racing cyclist who rides for the UCI Continental team WIGGINS. Nicknamed \\\"Wiggo\\\", he began his cycling career on the track, but has made the transition to road cycling and is one of the few cyclists to gain significant elite level success in both those forms of professional cycling. He is the only rider to have combined winning both World and Olympic championships on both the track and the road, as well as winning the Tour de France, and holding the iconic track hour record. In addition, he has worn the leader's jersey in each of the three Grand Tours of cycling and as of 2016 holds the world record in team pursuit. The son of the Australian cyclist Gary Wiggins, Wiggins was born to a British mother in Ghent, Belgium, and raised in London from the age of two. He competed on the track from the early part of his career until 2008. Between 2000 and 2008 he won ten medals at the track world championships, of which six were gold: three in the individual pursuit, two in the team pursuit and one in the madison. His first Olympic medal was a silver in the team pursuit in Sydney 2000, before winning three medals including the gold in the individual pursuit at the Athens 2004, and two golds in the individual and team pursuit at the Beijing 2008. On the road, Wiggins turned professional in 2001, but made it his focus from 2008. Initially viewed as a time trial specialist and as a rouleur, he showed his ability in stage races when he came fourth in the 2009 Tour de France; he was later promoted to third after Lance Armstrong's results were annulled in 2012. He signed with the newly formed Team Sky in 2010, and in 2011 he claimed his first victory in a major stage race in the Critérium du Dauphiné, as well as finishing third in the Vuelta a España. In 2012, Wiggins won the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie, the Critérium du Dauphiné, and became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France and the time trial at the Olympic Games. In 2014 he won gold in the time trial at the road world championships, and founded the WIGGINS cycling team. Wiggins returned to the track at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and in June 2015 he set a new hour record with a distance of 54.526 km (33.881 mi). In 2016 he won a further world championship in the madison, and gold in the team pursuit at the Olympics, his fifth successive medal winning appearance at the Games. Wiggins was awarded a CBE in 2009. Following his success in 2012, Wiggins was the subject of further honours and awards; the Vélo d'Or award for best rider of the year, the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award and a knighthood as part of the 2013 New Year Honours.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "Cyclist", "wiki_name": "Bradley_Wiggins", "word_count": 500, "label": "Cyclist", "people": "Bradley Wiggins", "anonymized_text": "An individual born in the late 20th century is a professional athlete who achieved elite success in two distinct disciplines of their sport.

Born in Valdosta, Georgia, he threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 ft 8 in (1.73 m) tall, and weighed 160 pounds (73 kg). He played in the Major Leagues during World War II, when the talent pool was depleted due to the military draft. Clary's Major League Baseball career began with the Washington Senators in 1942, and he hit .275 in 240 at-bats as an infielder. In 1943, he was traded during the season to the St. Louis Browns, where he became a reserve player. He was a member of St. Louis' only American League championship team, the 1944 Browns. In 1945, Clary batted just .211. Despite his own poor performance, he blamed the team's struggles on one-armed outfielder Pete Gray. Clary was sent down to the minor league Toledo Mud Hens in 1946. His career big league batting average was .263. Following his playing career, Clary was a coach for the Senators for six seasons (1955–60), and then switched to scouting when the team relocated to Minneapolis–St. Paul. He scouted for the Twins for 24 years, then worked for the Chicago White Sox and Toronto Blue Jays as a special assignment scout until his 1993 retirement.

In the panorama \\\"Taken From Nicolai Hill,\\\" you get a little snapshot of the Hubrick party at a photography shoot. You can see two riding horses, pack animals, and his guide. It is said that most of Mr. Hubrick's photographs were personally sold in or around McCarthy, Alaska circa 1916-1930. The best count (guess) of known existing original photographic prints puts the number around 25. There are also some negatives. Hubrick copies are sold in Alaska for around $45. In addition to art, panoramas like those of J.P. Hubrick have other uses. They are used today to measure and compare changes in snow pack, providing valuable evidence on issues such as global warming. And herd sizes? How many goats, do you think, would be walking that trail today? Hubrick died of diabetes in 1930. His works are considered very rare.

Born in Barmouth, Merioneth to Christopher Nutter and Dorothy (formerly Banister), he was raised in Edgware, Middlesex, where his father owned a local High Street Cafe. After the family moved to Kilburn, Nutter and his brother David attended Willesden Technical College. Nutter initially studied plumbing, and then architecture, but he abandoned both aged 19 to study tailoring at the Tailor and Cutter Academy. In the early 1960s he joined traditional tailors Donaldson, Williamson & Ward. After seven years, in 1969, he joined up with Edward Sexton, to open Nutters of Savile Row at No 35a Savile Row. They were financially backed by Cilla Black and her husband Bobby Willis, Managing Director of the Beatles' Apple Corps Peter Brown, and lawyer James Vallance-White. The business was an immediate success, as Nutter combined traditional tailoring skills with innovative design. He designed for the Hardy Amies range, and then for the man himself. His clients included his investors, plus Sir Roy Strong, Mick Jagger, Bianca Jagger and Elton John. Nutter himself was most proud of the fact that, for the cover of The Beatles' album Abbey Road in 1969, he dressed three out of the four: George Harrison elected to be photographed on the road-crossing in denims. In the 1970s his bespoke business became less successful, but he branched out into ready to wear clothing, marketed through Austin Reed. He also successfully expanded into East Asia, establishing the Savile Row brand in Japan. In 1976 Sexton bought Nutter out of the Business. Nutter went to work for Kilgour French and Stanbury, managing his own workroom. Sexton continued to run Nutters of Savile Row until 1983, when Nutter returned to the row with a ready to wear shop: \\\"Tommy Nutter, Savile Row\\\". (This new venture, which traded at No 19 Savile Row until Tommy's death, was backed by J&J Crombie Limited, who continue to own the \\\"Tommy Nutter\\\" trademark.) At this time, Sexton set up a business in his own name. In the 1980s, he described his suits as a \\\"cross between the big-shouldered Miami Vice look and the authentic Savile Row.\\\" He created the clothing of The Joker worn by Jack Nicholson in the 1989 film Batman.

In 1920 he went to study in Dresden (Germany) where he studied architecture at the Technische Universität Dresden and music at the Hochschule für Musik Carl Maria von Weber with Karl Fehling (piano), Theodor Blumer and Paul Bitner (composition and music theory). In 1925 Dimitar Nenov obtains the position of Music Director of the Thea Jolles dance company. In 1927 Nenov graduated in Architecture and returned to Bulgaria where he worked for a while as architect at the Ministry of public buildings, roads and public works (1927- 1930) and at the General Directorate of Railways (1929–32).

Ludvig Petersen died 10 April 1935 and is buried at Holmens Cemetery in Copenhagen. Ludvig Petersen was originally trained as a carpenter between 1865-68 but attended the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen from where he graduated with a degree in architecture. Between 1872-80 he was a teacher at the Technical School in Copenhagen before he moved to Vejle to work both as a teacher and principal in the Vejle Technical School between 1880 and 1888. From 1888 to 1918 he lived and worked in Aarhus as a teacher the technical school there. In 1877-80 he worked as the conductor at the renovation of Aarhus Cathedral under Wilhelm Theodor Walther.

{"text": "Dirk DeWayne Minniefield (born January 17, 1961) is an American retired professional basketball player. While at Lafayette High School in Lexington, he was named the 1979 Kentucky \\\"Mr. Basketball\\\", an honor given to the top high school player in the state of Kentucky. In addition to \\\"Mr. Basketball\\\", he was also named a McDonald's and Parade High School All-American. Minniefield played his college ball at the University of Kentucky (UK), where he became a member of the 1,000 point club. In 1983, he was drafted in the second round (33rd overall) by the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. The 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), 180 lb (82 kg) guard played three seasons in NBA, making stops in Cleveland, Houston, Golden State, and Boston. Minniefield began regularly using marijuana at age 14. Minniefield, who has been sober since the early 1990s, told a group of top high school prospects in 2007 that \\\"My younger kids have never seen me take a drink. They don't know the daddy the older kids know. They know a totally different guy.\\\" (Minniefield was a father of three children by the time he graduated from high school, and has two children from his current marriage). His drug problem continued into college. He admitted to having carried a vial of cocaine with him regularly during his senior year at UK, and frequently took hits of the drug before games. Most notably, he admitted in 2007 that he and several teammates had gone to a park in Knoxville, Tennessee the night before Kentucky's showdown with Louisville in the 1983 NCAA Mideast Regional final and smoked marijuana. He also said that he smoked more marijuana after returning to his hotel room. As fate would have it, he had the ball late in the game, with UK clinging to a narrow lead. He went into the lane and threw up a tentative shot that UofL center Charles Jones blocked. The Cardinals went on to force overtime and then dominated the extra period, winning 80-68. He would later say about the incident, Minniefield's drug use eventually contributed to the early end of his NBA career. He returned to Lexington, but wound up serving a year in jail after writing bad checks and violating probation on those charges. His first wife divorced him and he left Lexington \\\"penniless\\\". He found his way to the John Lucas Drug Abuse Center in Houston; Minniefield would say of Lucas, \\\"I finally found that person who talked my language. He could see past the outside facade I learned to put up.\\\" For his part, Lucas said, \\\"I call him one of my children. He's delightful. He's helped me as much as I helped him.\\\" After treatment, Minniefield worked as transportation manager—according to him, \\\"A better word is van driver\\\"—for the San Antonio Spurs while Lucas was coach. He would go on to be a head coach/general manager in the United States Basketball League (USBL) for the Miami Tropics (a team that Lucas owned) and serve as the Spurs' strength and conditioning coach.

Wayne also did five tours for Carlsberg Beer in Europe. In 1993 Wayne wrote and performed his one-man show, Big Daddy's Barbeque.

{"text": "Luke Joseph Cummo (born April 27, 1980) is a former mixed martial artist who appeared in the second season of the reality TV series The Ultimate Fighter on Spike TV. After winning two exhibition fights, he made it to the finals where he was defeated by Joe Stevenson by decision in a close bout. Cummo gained recognition on the show due to his personality, vegan and unorthodox diet (which according to Joe Rogan includes urine therapy when sick), his striking ability and his love of comic books. He was also the last person picked for a team on the show, fighting throughout the show as the underdog. Cummo fights out of Long Island, where he attended Chaminade High School (class of 1998) in Mineola, New York and works with (Matt Serra) Serra Jiu-Jitsu and Ray Longo's IMAA. Even though Cummo lost to Joe Stevenson at The Ultimate Fighter 2 finale, his performance earned him a UFC contract. Although his grappling ability has been improving, his primary style remains Muay Thai kickboxing. He also holds a Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu purple belt. In his first match under a UFC contract at UFC Ultimate Fight Night 4, he defeated Jason Von Flue via unanimous decision. In his next fight, he was defeated by Canadian fighter Jonathan Goulet, who scored a decision victory over Cummo with superior wrestling and ground control.

{"text": "Richard Bernard \\\"Red\\\" Skelton (July 18, 1913 – September 17, 1997) was an American entertainer. He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. Skelton, who has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. He then spent time on a showboat, worked the burlesque circuit, then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The Doughnut Dunkers, a pantomime sketch of how different people ate doughnuts written by Skelton and his wife launched a career for him in vaudeville, in radio and in films. Skelton's radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour which led to his becoming the host of Avalon Time in 1938. He became the host of The Raleigh Cigarette Program in 1941 where many of his comedy characters were created and had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in Alfred Santell's Having Wonderful Time, and he went on to appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, with starring roles in Ship Ahoy (1941), I Dood It (1943), Ziegfeld Follies (1946) and The Clown (1953). He was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. The Red Skelton Show made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on NBC. By 1954, Skelton's program moved to CBS, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed The Red Skelton Hour in 1962. Despite high ratings, his television show was cancelled by CBS in 1970 as the network believed more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. After he no longer had a television program, Skelton's time was spent making up to 125 personal appearances a year and on his artwork. Skelton's artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964 when his wife, Georgia, convinced him to have a showing of his work at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful and Skelton also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work. Skelton believed his life's work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans during this time. Many of Skelton's personal and professional effects, including prints of his artwork, were donated to Vincennes University by his widow, where they are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Comedian", "wiki_name": "Red_Skelton", "word_count": 540, "label": "Comedian", "people": "Red Skelton", "anonymized_text": "An individual active during the mid-to-late twentieth century gained recognition in the performing arts through various public-facing roles over a long professional lifespan.

His treatise, first published by Henrico Waltkirch, is also regarded as one of the finest examples of baroque printing, with its 191 copperplate engravings by Jan van Haelbeck, Francesco Valeggio and possibly other artists. This book is also important to bibliophiles because it is the first Danish book to feature copperplate engravings. Fabris was also the Supreme Knight of the Order of the Seven Hearts, a chivalrous order of which we do not yet know much today.

The combination of competition, film work, teaching, writing, and a celebrity family link narrows it down. Chuck Norris is a strong candidate due to his rank, film career, and family connection (e.g., brother Aaron Norris in entertainment), but he lacks the drug legal issues. Others like Steven Seagal or Gene LeBell might fit some clues but not all perfectly. The drug issue suggests someone like Jeff Speakman or Don \"The Dragon\" Wilson, but they lack the high-profile family link. The wedding detail is critical—tying to a figure like Elvis Presley (e.g., through marriage to Priscilla Presley's family) could point to martial artists in that circle, but it's rare. Re-evaluating, the \"family member of a well-known entertainment figure\" might refer to a sibling or in-law in the industry, not necessarily a spouse. This broadens possibilities to include figures like Cynthia Rothrock (though she has fewer legal issues) or Benny \"The Jet\" Urquidez (connected to entertainment). However, the most cohesive match is someone with all elements: high rank, teaching, films, writing, drug charges, and a celebrity relative. Michael Jai White has some matches but no major drug issues. After cross-referencing, the profile aligns closely with **Dan Inosanto** (taught Bruce Lee's family, film roles), but he lacks drug legal troubles. Alternatively, **Ed Parker** (Kenpo founder, taught Elvis) fits many clues but died before modern drug issues.

Krol returned to the Cardinals as manager of the Triple-A Louisville Redbirds in 1992–93.

While he was studying martial arts with the Lam family, he became close friends with their son Lam Yiu Gwai, with whom he had much in common, and eventually studied under Yiu Gwai's uncle.

Born in Archer City in Archer County, a part of the Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area, Purcell attended public schools and received his Bachelor of Science from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in 1946, and his LL.B. in 1949 from Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas. Purcell served in the United States Army during World War II from 1941 to 1946 and served thereafter in the United States Army Reserve.He served as judge of the Eighty-ninth Judicial District Court of Texas from 1955 to 1962. He was a delegate to the 1960 and 1964 Democratic national conventions, which met in Los Angeles and Atlantic City, New Jersey, respectively to nominate the Kennedy-Johnson and the Johnson-Humphrey tickets, both of which prevailed in Texas. Purcell was elected to the Eighty-seventh Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of fellow Democrat, Representative Frank N. Ikard. He was reelected to the five succeeding congresses (January 27, 1962 – January 3, 1973). In 1966, when John Tower won his second term as U. S. senator, Purcell defeated the Republican Dillard Carlisle \\\"Bunny\\\" Norwood (1913-1993) of Wichita Falls. On November 22, 1963, Purcell was riding in the motorcade's third vehicle behind U.S. President Kennedy during the assassination in Dallas, Texas. Although Texas gained a seat as a result of the 1970 Census, Purcell's 13th District was dismantled, and his home in Wichita Falls was merged with the Panhandle-based 18th District of Republican Bob Price for the 1972 elections. The new district was numerically Purcell's district—the 13th—but was geographically more Price's district. Forced to run in territory that he did not know and that did not know him (the reconfigured district was more than two-thirds new to him), Purcell was defeated by nine points.

{"text": "\\\"Geki\\\" was the racing pseudonym of Giacomo Russo (23 October 1937 – 18 June 1967), who was a racing driver from Italy. An experienced driver in the Italian lower formulae, he also participated in three Formula One Italian Grands Prix from 1964–66, failing to qualify for the 1964 race, driving a Brabham for Rob Walker. For his two Grand Prix starts, he drove for Team Lotus. He scored no championship points. However, he was a four-time Italian Formula Three series champion, winning consecutive championships from 1961 to 1964. He was killed in a horrific accident in an Italian Formula Three race at Caserta in 1967. After a multiple accident involving Beat Fehr, Andrea Saltari and Franco Foresti, Fehr ran down the track to warn the oncoming racers of the damaged cars and oil on the track ahead. The next group of cars included Geki, Massimo Natili, Jürg Dubler, Romano \\\"Tiger\\\" Perdomi and Corrado Manfredini who were unable to avoid colliding with the wreckage on the track.

The driver used a pseudonym, competed in some top-level events without notable success, and died in a high-profile multi-fatality crash in 1967.\n\n- **Deduction**: The 1967 multi-fatality crash involving debris strongly points to the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans, where a Ford GT40 driven by Willy Mairesse crashed first, and then the McLaren-Ford of Lorenzo Bandini collided with debris, leading to Bandini's fatal accident. However, Bandini was Italian, not using a pseudonym, and was more successful internationally. Alternatively, the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans also had other incidents, but the most famous multi-fatality crash in 1967 was the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans involving Bandini. Another candidate is the 1967 1000 km of Nürburgring, but fewer fatalities. The pseudonym and national championship success from 1961–1964 suggest a driver like \"John Love\" (Rhodesian, not European) or \"Jean-Pierre Beltoise\" (French, no pseudonym). The pseudonym clue might point to a driver like \"Pedro Rodríguez\" (Mexican, not European) or \"Jo Bonnier\" (Swedish, no pseudonym). Re-evaluating: the 1967 crash with multiple fatalities could be the 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans (Bandini) or the 1967 1000 km of Nürburgring (multiple deaths). The national championship from 1961–1964 could be the British Saloon Car Championship, French F3, or Italian F3. A driver who fits many clues is \"John Rhodes\" (British, used pseudonym? Not typically), or \"Mike Parkes\" (British, no pseudonym). Another candidate: \"Ludovico Scarfiotti\" (Italian, no pseudonym). The pseudonym is key—perhaps \"Giancarlo Baghetti\" (Italian, no pseudonym). Alternatively, \"Jo Schlesser\" (French, no pseudonym) died in 1968. The most likely is \"Lorenzo Bandini\" (Italian, no pseudonym), but the pseudonym doesn't fit. Perhaps the pseudonym refers to a driver like \"Chris Amon\" (New Zealander, not European). Given the constraints, I'll focus on European drivers with pseudonyms who died in 1967 multi-fatality crashes. The 1967 24 Hours of Le Mans had Bandini (Italian, no pseudonym) and others. A driver with a pseudonym who died in 1967 is \"Mike Spence\" (British, no pseudonym). Another is \"Bob Anderson\" (British, no pseudonym). The pseudonym might be \"John Surtees\" (British, no pseudonym). I'll consider drivers who used a pseudonym like \"Jean-Pierre Jarier\" (French, but raced later). After research recall: \"John Taylor\" (British) died in 1966. \"Bruce McLaren\" (New Zealander) died in 1970. The 1967 1000 km of Nürburgring had fatalities, but drivers like \"Carel Godin de Beaufort\" died in 1964. Given the difficulty, I'll rank based on best match to clues: pseudonym, European, national champion 1961–1964, died in 1967 multi-fatality crash.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. Lorenzo Bandini (Italian, died in 1967 Le Mans multi-fatality crash, but no pseudonym)\n2. Mike Parkes (British, died in 1977, not 1967)\n3. Jo Bonnier (Swedish, died in 1972)\n4.

Pedro Rodríguez (Mexican, not European, died 1971)\n9. Graham Hill (British, died 1975)\n10. Jackie Stewart (British, still alive)\n\nNote: The pseudonym clue is problematic; none of the well-known European drivers who died in 1967 used a pseudonym. The closest match to the crash description is Lorenzo Bandini, but he didn't use a pseudonym. The national championship 1961–1964 might refer to the British Touring Car Championship, won by drivers like John Whitmore (British, no pseudonym). Given the constraints, I've listed drivers active in the 1960s who died in racing incidents, with Bandini as the best match for the 1967 crash."}, "loss_description_sentence": "The person's pseudonym was \"Geki\", their real name was Giacomo Russo, they were a Formula One driver for Team Lotus and Rob Walker's Brabham team, a four-time Italian Formula Three champion, and they died driving a Matra at Caserta.", "label_accurate": "Italian Formula Three Champion"}

After racing motorbikes, he switched to Formula Junior, becoming the best German driver with 40 victories. In addition, he sold two-stroke engines for FJ. In 1963, Mitter won the Formula Junior Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring. Mitter also participated in seven Grands Prix, debuting on 23 June 1963.

In 1945, she established the first mothers' milk bank at Delaware Hospital (now Wilmington Hospital) in Wilmington, Delaware. Handy was born in Smyrna, Delaware and was the daughter of L. Irving Handy, a U.S. Representative. She attended Goucher College and Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine from which she graduated in 1916. She was the first native-born female Delawarean to become a doctor and was also the state’s first pediatrician. In 1918, during an outbreak of Spanish influenza in the Wilmington area, Handy was asked by the Board of Health to open a paediatric ward at People's Settlement staffed by volunteers and with very little equipment. She subsequently established a pediatric clinic and became Assistant Chief, and in 1921, Chief, of Pediatrics at Delaware Hospital where she set up a nursery for premature babies. Handy collected surplus breast milk in the community to feed the babies of mothers who could not breast feed, and in 1945 founded the Mother's Milk Bank with Margaret Trentman, a hospital board member whose baby son had died because she was unable to nurse him. The bank supplied breast milk to mothers throughout the United States as well as for research purposes, for 40 years. She also helped to establish ophthalmology as a speciality in Delaware, with Norman Cutler becoming the first state-certified ophthalmologist in 1947. Handy received a number of awards including the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary's Elizabeth Blackwell Citation (honoring female doctors) and the Annie Jump Cannon medal from Wesley College as well as the 1953 Josiah Marvel Cup for outstanding contributions to the state and to society in the field of children's medicine. The Margaret Handy Lectureship at Christiana Hospital in [Newark, Delaware] is named for her. Andrew Wyeth painted The Children's Doctor, a \\\"votive-like\\\" portrait of Handy, in 1949 after she treated his son Nicholas at his remote farm.

He gained his Diploma of Architecture at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. In 1921 he joined the group around Le Corbusier and L'Esprit Nouveau in Paris. Then studied from 1922-4 at the Staatliche Kunstakademie, Berlin, in the studio of German architect Hans Poelzig. His firs significant project District Labour Insurance Building (1923), in Zagreb, was the first project to reflect the spirit of the modern architectural movement in Yugoslavia. Between 1925 and 1935 he established the so call Zagreb school of architecture with fellow architects Drago Galić, Mladen Kauzlarić, Stjepan Planić and others. Drago Ibler was a fellow and protagonist of the social ideals of modern architecture as well as the aesthetics, and he founded the Earth Group (Croatian: Grupa Zemlja), with a group of left-oriented progressive artists. He was also a member of CIAM. From the 1920s and 1930s Ibler worked on numerous architectural competitions, but with poor results due to conservative environment and resistance to his progressive ideas.In this time he executed villas on the island of Korčula and in Zagreb, several industrial buildings, the District Labour Insurance Building in Mostar, built in 1930 (Today the simple ambulance) this building has a beautiful convex half-ring-shaped entrance with a porch, and a dynamical balance of the low office building and the tall volume of the residential part and stairways. After that he designed the District Labour Insurance Building (1932), Skopje, which was important for architecture in Yugoslavia, by introducing Le Corbusier's principles, including ribbon windows. From 1926 Drago Ibler became a professor at the Zagreb Academy of Fine Arts, where he taught architecture until 1941. After that he relocated to Switzerland and joined the University of Geneva as a lecturer in architecture. After the war, in 1950, he returned to Zagreb, and led a Master Studio in architecture and returned to teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts. After the World War II he started to be not so rigid functionalist and he encouraged the humanization of architecture by means of more decorative, sculptural and harmonious compositions, for example in his designs for the New Opera House (1948; unrealized) in Belgrade. He made excellent designs for the New Yugoslav Embassy in Moscow (1959; unrealized), and New Tito's Residence (1961- 4; unrealized) in Zagreb. Before his death in the automobile accident close to Novo Mesto in Slovenia, he designed several residential blocks in the centre of Zagreb, which are characterized by simplicity and functional planning, in Marticeva, Smiciklasova and Vlaska Streets.

His first major client was Dallas, Texas hotel owner Ben Whitaker for whom \\\"Jimmy\\\" Conway conditioned the 1948 and 1953 American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly, Miss Request and Grecian Queen. Whitaker died in April 1954, and Conway's next Champion was with another filly named Pucker Up. Owned by Ada L. Rice, Pucker Up was the 1957 American Champion Older Female Horse. From 1962 to 1966 Jimmy Conway trained for John Galbreath's Darby Dan Farm with whom he would enjoy his greatest success. In his first year with Darby Dan, Conway conditioned the filly Primonetta to 1962 American Champion Older Female Horse honors then the following year won two of the U.S. Triple Crown races with Chateaugay. The colt won the 1963 Kentucky Derby at 1¼ miles, finished second to Candy Spots in the 1³/16 mile Preakness Stakes, then won the 1½ mile Belmont Stakes. Chateaugay would be Conway's fifth Champion, voted 1963 American Champion Three-Year-Old Male Horse. Besides his 1963 win in the Kentucky Derby, Conway had four other horses who ran in the prestigious race: 1948 (3rd), 1957 (6th), 1968 (2nd), 1970 (12th). After leaving the Darby Dan stable, in 1967 Conway returned to operating a public stable, training horses for notable owners such as Maxwell Gluck's Elmendorf Farm.

Their work, using black-and-white photography and film, captured a specific geographic region (likely the United States, possibly the Midwest or Northeast) during the transition from steam to diesel locomotives. Their images were published in magazines and books, and one was included in a notable collection of railroad photographs, such as those curated by the Center for Railroad Photography & Art or similar institutions.\n\n- **Deduction**: This profile strongly aligns with photographers known for railroad documentation in the U.S. during the mid-20th century. Key figures include O. Winston Link, David Plowden, and Jim Shaughnessy, but the lifespan and timeline point most strongly to those who began in the 1930s and focused on monochrome work. The mention of a family connection to the industry and survival of rare regional records narrows it down further. O. Winston Link is famous for his 1950s steam locomotive work, but he was born in 1914 and didn't start as early as the 1930s, making him less likely. David Plowden (born 1932) is too young. Jim Shaughnessy (1937–2019) is also too late. Thus, the top guess is a photographer like Philip R. \"Phil\" Hastings or others from that cohort, but the clues fit best with a figure like Wallace W. Abbey or similar, though Abbey was born in 1924. Re-evaluating, the dates and emphasis on early work suggest someone like David Plowden's predecessors, but Plowden himself doesn't match the birth year. After cross-referencing, the most plausible is **David Plowden** if the birth year is flexible, but given the constraints, I'll prioritize those with exact matches to 1916 and 1930s start, leading to **Philip R. Hastings** (1925–2007) as a close match, though not perfect. Adjusting for accuracy, the top guess becomes **O. Winston Link** due to iconic status, despite birth year mismatch, as the text may have approximate details. Ultimately, the profile is consistent with several railroad photographers, and I'll rank based on overall alignment.\n\n**Top-10 Guesses**:\n1. O. Winston Link\n2. David Plowden\n3.

Hockley was born in Paignton, Devon and joined Torquay United as a trainee.

He made sporadic appearance over the next two seasons before becoming a regular under Leroy Rosenior, missing only one game in the 2003-04 promotion season. He is nicknamed 'Pitbull' due to his tenacious tackling. In May 2005, he accepted a new contract with Torquay  and in the 2006-07 season made his 200th first team appearance for the Gulls. His 200th league appearance came on 2 March 2007 in a 1-1 draw away to Chester City, Hockley replacing Lloyd Kerry as a late substitute. Torquay were relegated to the Conference National at the end of the 2006-07 season, but Hockley chose to remain with the club, agreeing a new contract with new Torquay manager Paul Buckle. He was an unused substitute in Torquay's FA Trophy Final defeat at Wembley in May 2008, and was released by Torquay three days later. Hockley joined Truro City in June 2008.

He began his career with a hometown or regional club, progressed from youth/reserves to the first team, and became a loyal, determined player with many appearances. He experienced relegation with his club but remained loyal, was part of a cup final squad without playing, left soon after, had short stints elsewhere, and now plays for a club where he joined on a free transfer. A family member (e.g., brother, father) also played for the same original club.\n\n- **Deduction**:\n  The clues strongly point to a footballer with a long tenure at one club, known for loyalty and a gritty playing style. The \"significant national tournament final\" is likely the FA Cup or League Cup in England. The player not participating in the final but departing shortly after suggests a sentimental exit. The family connection narrows it to players like the Neville brothers (Gary and Phil) or others with relatives at the same club. Gary Neville fits many clues but was born in 1975 and didn't have a family member play for Manchester United in the same way (Phil Neville did, but Gary is older). Re-evaluating: the early 1980s birth, developmental role, and family tie point to players like John O'Shea (born 1981, Manchester United), but he didn't have a family member at United. Considering clubs with strong family ties: Southampton (the Chamberlains), West Ham (the Ferdinands), or others. The profile best matches a player like Leon Britton (born 1982, Swansea City), but no family tie. After cross-referencing known players, the clues align with **Gary Hooper** (born 1988, too young), but more likely **James Milner** (born 1986, not early 80s). Adjusting for age and family: **Stephen Ireland** (born 1986) doesn't fit. The family clue is key—considering **Danny Higginbotham** (born 1978) or **Ryan Shawcross** (born 1987). However, the early 1980s birth and family tie strongly suggest **Gary Speed** (born 1969, too old) or **Neil Lennon** (born 1971). Reassessing: the player is likely from the early 1980s with a brother who also played for the club, e.g., **Gary and Phil Neville** (but Gary born 1975), **Michael and Brian Laudrup** (not English). In English football, **Gary and Phil Neville** are the most prominent, but Gary's birth year is 1975. If \"early 1980s\" is approximate, Gary Neville fits: born 1975, came through United's youth, made 400+ appearances, stayed after relegation? United weren't relegated. This contradicts. Perhaps the club is not top-tier always, e.g., a Championship side. Considering **Jermaine Beckford** (born 1983) but no family tie. The \"national tournament final\" could be the FA Cup or Play-off final. The player not playing in the final but leaving soon after suggests a farewell. The family tie narrows to **Gary and Phil Neville** (Phil born 1977), but Phil left United in 2005. Alternatively, **John and Paul Terry** (John born 1980, Paul was a youth player at Chelsea). John Terry fits: born 1980, Chelsea youth, captain, loyal, 500+ appearances, stayed after relegation? Chelsea weren't relegated. He was in the 2008 UCL final but played. Not fitting. After careful synthesis, the profile best matches **Gary Neville** (despite birth year discrepancy) or a similar player like **Jamie Carragher** (born 1978, Liverpool, no family tie).

Together they designed several churches in Yorkshire and Liverpool, and also worked on the Isle of Anglesey. In 1831 they won the competition to design Birmingham Town Hall. However they were obliged to stand surety for the builders, which led to their bankruptcy and the dissolution of the partnership in 1834.

{"text": "William \\\"Bill\\\" Barton Bridgeman (1916 – September 29, 1968) was an American test pilot who broke aviation records while working for the Douglas Aircraft Company, testing experimental aircraft. In July 1951, the United States Navy announced the D-558-II Skyrocket piloted by Bridgeman had \\\"attained the highest speed and altitude ever recorded by a piloted plane.\\\" On August 15 of the same year, he set a world record with a speed of Mach 1.88 and an unofficial record height of 79,494 feet (24,230 m). Bridgeman was born in Iowa. His father was a barnstormer and separated from his mother shortly after he was born. He was raised in Malibu, California by his paternal grandmother. He enlisted in the United States Navy to attend flight school at Pensacola. He graduated and was commissioned in 1941, and was sent to Pearl Harbor, where he experienced the Japanese attack on December 7. He flew PBY flying boats in the New Guinea/Australia sector, then four-engined PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bombers on a tour of operations with VP/VPB-109 (the \\\"Reluctant Raiders\\\"). He was reassigned afterwards to training activities stateside from August 1944 until the end of the war, then spent two years flying transport missions from Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. Upon leaving the Navy in 1947, Bridgeman joined Southwest Airlines (a local West Coast airline that eventually merged into Pacific Southwest Airlines, not to be confused with today's Southwest) to fly DC-3s on the San Francisco-Seattle route. Bored with the airline routine, he left in 1949 to join Douglas as a production test pilot to certify A-1 Skyraiders off the assembly line before their delivery to the Navy. A few months later, he was offered and accepted to take over the test program of the D-558 II Skyrocket, one of the world's first supersonic research aircraft. Bridgeman converted to jet aircraft on the F-80 in early 1950 and eventually conducted a very successful test program with the Skyrocket, collecting data on the behavior of swept-wing aircraft over a wide envelope of load factors and Mach numbers deep in the supersonic range. In May 1951, he broke the world speed record with Mach 1.72, then raised the record to Mach 1.88 (1,245 mph, 1,992 km/h) the next month. Immediately afterwards, he broke the world altitude record with 79,494 ft (24,230 m) on the Skyrocket's final flight before delivery to NACA. During this campaign, Bridgeman was one of the first pilots to encounter the phenomenon of inertia coupling, a flight hazard that would dominate high-speed aircraft research for much of the 1950s. He was on the cover of the April 27, 1953 issue of Time magazine. He went on to fly other Douglas test programs including the X-3 Stiletto, a promising but ultimately unsuccessful design. In 1955, he recounted his experiences test-flying the Skyraider and Skyrocket in a successful memoir, The Lonely Sky, written with Jacqueline Hazard, whom he married shortly after the book was published. He was an astronaut candidate for the United States Air Force Man In Space Soonest program, but the program was cancelled on August 1, 1958, and replaced by NASA's Project Mercury. Bridgeman eventually moved to Grumman Aircraft where he conducted test programs of commercial aircraft, then pursued a career in commercial real estate. In September 1968, he was the pilot of a routine air-taxi flight from Los Angeles to Santa Catalina Island when his Grumman Goose amphibian went down in the Pacific Ocean.

Born on a farm near Markleysburg, Pennsylvania to Christian and Susan Fiske Thomas, Lot Thomas attended the public schools in Pennsylvania, then Vermillion Institute in Hayesville, Ohio.He moved to Iowa in 1868. After teaching school in New Virginia, in Warren County, he attended the University of Iowa College of Law. He was admitted to the bar in 1870.That year he moved to Sioux Rapids in Buena Vista County, Iowa, where he started his law practice. When the county seat was moved to Storm Lake, Thomas also moved there. He was Buena Vista County Attorney from 1872 to 1885. From 1885 until 1898, he served as judge of the fourteenth judicial district of Iowa (which included Buena Vista, Palo Alto, Pocahontas, Dickinson, Emmett, Kossuth, Humboldt, and Clay Counties). In February 1898, Thomas challenged incumbent Republican Congressman George D. Perkins for the Republican nomination for the 11th congressional district seat held by Perkins since 1891. After defeating Perkins for the nomination on the 217th ballot, he resigned his judgeship effective August 16, 1898. Thomas won the general election, and in 1899 became a member of the Fifty-sixth Congress. He was re-elected twice, and served in the Fifty-seventh, and Fifty-eighth Congresses. Thomas' service in Congress coincided with a worsening of factionalism within the Iowa Republican Party, with an \\\"insurgent\\\" contingent loyal to the career and platform of Des Moines attorney (and later Governor and U.S. Senator) Albert B. Cummins, and another \\\"stand-patter\\\" faction hostile toward Cummins. Thomas was considered a leader in the pro-Cummins faction. He also served on the House Committee on the Judiciary. He tried and failed to win renominated by his party in 1904. In all, Thomas served in Congress from March 4, 1899 to March 3, 1905.

He hit a single in his only Major League at bat, on June 3, 1990, giving him a lifetime batting average of 1.000. His Major League slugging percentage and on-base percentage are also 1.000. His at bat came in the 8th inning of a game against the Philadelphia Phillies as a pinch hitter for Mets' catcher Mackey Sasser against pitcher Pat Combs. His hit came on the only Major League pitch he ever faced; author George Rose estimates that his Major League career as a hitter thus lasted only about 20 seconds.

After the 1990 season, he was signed by the Cincinnati Reds as a free agent, but he never played in the Reds' system. Liddell was a 4th round draft pick of the Chicago Cubs in 1984 – the 83rd overall pick in the draft – after attending Rubidoux High School in Riverdale, California.

{"text": "Charles Josiah Belden (November 16, 1887, San Francisco, California – February 1, 1966, St. Petersburg, Florida) was a photographer and rancher who was famous for his visceral photographs of the area around Meetseetse, Wyoming. Belden was born in San Francisco into a wealthy California family. His grandfather, Josiah Belden, was an early California pioneer who made millions in San Francisco real estate and was the first Mayor of San Jose. After graduating from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Charles Belden bought his first camera to record a European tour with his school friend, Eugene Phelps. The highlight of the tour was a journey through Russia in Belden's 1908 Packard, the first automobile to make such a trip in the country. After the trip, Belden went to work as a cowboy on the Phelps (Pitchfork) Ranch in Wyoming. In 1912, Belden married Eugene's sister, Frances. The couple had three children, Annice, Margot, and Mary Elizabeth, who died while still a toddler. Eugene's father died in 1922, leaving Eugene and Charles to take over management of the Pitchfork Ranch. Belden's 1921–1940 photographs of the Pitchfork Ranch were widely published, including in The Saturday Evening Post, National Geographic, and on the cover of Life magazine. Airplanes became a fascination for Belden. In the late 1920s, Charles became involved in raising antelope and sending them by airplane to zoos around the world, including some to Germany in the Hindenburg. He helped to pioneer the process of planting fish from the air and filmed the experience for future reference. In addition, he helped the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission conduct a census of wildlife herd populations using aerial photographs. Estate taxes, mismanagement, and an agricultural depression that began in 1921 took their toll on the Pitchfork and the ranch fell into decline. To meet expenses, in the 1930s the family turned their home into a dude ranch, but this response did not stop the financial drain. After many years of strained relations, Charles divorced Frances in 1940 and moved to Florida with a new wife, Verna Steele Belden. Charles Belden died in 1966 of a self-inflicted gunshot wound in St. Petersburg, Florida.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Photographer", "wiki_name": "Charles_Belden", "word_count": 356, "label": "Photographer", "people": "Charles Belden", "anonymized_text": "An individual born in the late 19th century into an affluent family pursued technical education before acquiring photographic equipment to document travels abroad.

Nicholson also worked for Cosworth, Lotus and Embassy Hill, and he prepared a Saab engine for use in a Reynard Formula Three car. Following his Formula Atlantic success, Nicholson commissioned Martin Slater of Lyncar to build him a Formula One car, despite, by this time, having established his own engine building business, which meant he was unable to commit to a full grand prix season. His race entries, therefore, were mainly in non-championship races. He entered the British Grand Prix in 1974 and 1975 and qualified for the latter race. He was classified 17th, five laps behind, despite crashing in the heavy storm towards the end of the race. Nicholson subsequently planned a further and stronger attempt at Formula One with a privateer McLaren M23 but the purchase of the chassis fell through.

{"text": "Sir Norman Andrew Forster Rowntree (11 March 1912 – 1991) was a British civil engineer. Rowntree was born in London in 1912 and held a Bachelor of Science degree in engineering. He worked as an engineering consultant for Alcott & Lomax, who would be acquired by Babtie in 2000. During his consulting career he was involved with the construction of water pumping stations. Rowntree was appointed director of the Water Resources Board (WRB), a national water planning body established in 1964. The WRB was dominated by civil engineers and focussed its efforts on implementing structural solutions to water resource problems. Rowntree was a keen proponent of that school of thought saying in 1962 that \\\"the solution of water supply problems … will require the construction and operation of large works and highly‐developed technical control\\\". Under Rowntree's leadership the WRB was able to undertake what was the largest scheme of water planning yet seen in England and Wales. Rowntree was made a Knight Bachelor in Elizabeth II's birthday honours on 13 June 1970. Rowntree gave the Institution of Electrical Engineers 1972 Graham Clark Lecture on \\\"Conservation and use of water resources\\\" and the same year wrote an article for the Proceedings of the Royal Society B entitled \\\"Water Resources Management in England and Wales\\\". By 1974 he had become a Professor and, on 2 December that year, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by City University London. Rowntree was elected president of the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE) for the November 1975–76 session. He used his inaugural presidential address to emphasise that \\\"the duty remains with engineers and other experts to minimise the range of intangible issues… the inaccuracy of words and the opportunities of distortion are enormous. In the present age of unreason this is a real danger and may be responsible for many of our present ills\\\". He was a chartered engineer and a fellow of the institution. In 1976 Rowntree was employed by the Department of Civil Engineering of the University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology and, on 8 December, gave the 63rd Thomas Hawksley lecture to the Institution of Mechanical Engineers on the history of water engineering. In August 1986 he wrote an article in the Proceedings of the ICE comparing water resources planning in the United Kingdom with that of New Jersey in the USA.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Norman_Rowntree", "word_count": 393, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Norman Rowntree", "anonymized_text": "An individual born in the early 20th century in a major city held an engineering degree and worked as a consultant in that field.

{"text": "John Wesley was born in Los Angeles, California, on November 25, 1928. He is a pop artist. After holding a series of odd jobs, he began painting at the age of 22. His first exhibition consisted mostly of large-format acrylic paintings of imaginary seals and stamps; he would retain the flatness and limited color range of these works, but would move into the depiction of bodies and cartoon characters, the latter of which led him to be grouped with Pop Art as the 1960s progressed. The spareness of his technique often seems more akin to the school known as Minimalism, however, and indeed his closest personal associations were with artists such as Dan Flavin and Donald Judd, the latter of whom wrote a laudatory essay on Wesley's early work and later set aside a space for him at his complex in Marfa, Texas. Wesley himself considers his work to be aligned with Surrealism, and many of his paintings since the 1960s have taken this dimension yet further, while retaining an extremely limited range of colors and a sign-like flatness. Several retrospectives of his work have been held, the most recent at the P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center in 2000. He was invited to design the cover for the catalogue of the 2006 Armory Show, and his recent paintings were given a substantial amount of space at the Fredericks and Freiser Gallery booth, which represents him. Replicas of his paintings were also featured in the window of the Hermès boutique on Madison Avenue for the duration of the show.

{"text": "(This article is about the former cosmonaut. For the Russian singer, see Valentina Ponomaryova (singer).) Valentina Leonidovna Ponomaryova (Russian: Валентина Леонидовна Пономарёва, born 18 September 1933) is a former Soviet cosmonaut, pilot and scientist. Left the school for girls №156 in Moscow with a gold medal, 1951. Graduated from Moscow Aviation Institute, 1957, and Zhukovsky-Academy, Monino, 1967. In December 1961, the selection of female cosmonauts was authorised by the Soviet Government, with the specific intention of ensuring the first woman in space was a Soviet citizen. In February 1962 Ponomaryova was selected in a group of five female cosmonauts to be trained for a Vostok flight. The group spent several months in intensive training, concluding with examinations in November 1962, after which the four remaining candidates were commissioned Junior Lieutenants in the Soviet Air Force. Ponomaryova established herself one of the leading candidates with Valentina Tereshkova and Irina Solovyova, and a joint mission profile was developed that would see two women launched into space, on solo Vostok flights on consecutive days. The honour of being the first woman in space was to be given to Valentina Tereshkova who would launch first on Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit on Vostok 6. However Ponomaryova did not respond with standard Soviet cliches in interviews and her feminism made the Soviet leadership uneasy, and this led to the flight profile being altered in March 1963. Vostok 5 would now carry a male, cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky, flying the joint mission with Tereshkova aboard Vostok 6 in June 1963. Tereshkova's backup was Irina Solovyova, with Ponomaryova in a supporting 'second back-up' role. Despite this setback, Ponomaryova remained with the program until 1969. She was at one stage slated to fly on a circumlunar Soyuz flight in 1965 before substantial delays in the Soyuz spacecraft led to the cancellation of this flight. She was also to lead an all-female crew on a ten-day mission aboard Voskhod 5 but the program was cancelled before she had a chance to fly. Ponomaryova retired in 1969 when it became clear that there were no plans for a female Soyuz flight. Ponomaryova later worked in orbital mechanics at the Gagarin Training Center. Following this, she was a research scientist at the Institute of Natural Historic Sciences. She was awarded a Candidate of Technical Sciences degree in 1974. She married fellow cosmonaut Yuri Ponomaryov in 1972 and the couple had two children before divorcing.

He joined the US Navy and underwent flight training at Naval Air Station Pensacola, Florida, which he completed in August 1958. He next served with Air Training Unit 203 at NAS Chase Field, Texas, after which he was transferred as F-8 Crusader pilot to the Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51) on board the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga. After four years in this assignment, he was assigned to the staff of the Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) as the CVW-5 landing signal officer (LSO), where he was the senior LSO responsible for the safety of carrier landings by the wing's assigned aircraft and pilots. In 1964, Finley attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California (Class 64-A). After graduation, he became an instructor at Edwards. Finley was selected as a USAF astronaut on November 12, 1965, envisaged to fly military Gemini missions in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory project. The project was delayed and eventually terminated. He resigned as astronaut in April 1968 and returned to the operational Navy. Subsequent assignments included a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1968. He subsequently served with the \\\"Sundowners\\\" of Fighter Squadron 111 (VF-111) at NAS Miramar, California flying the F-4 Phantom II, the \\\"Evaluators\\\" of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 4 (VX-4) at NAS Point Mugu, California as project officer, and Executive Officer and later Commanding Officer of the \\\"Screaming Eagles\\\" of VF-51, also flying the F-4.

Dietrich began flying at an early age, getting a student pilot certificate at age 16. She and identical twin sister Janet Dietrich were the only girls in an aviation class at Burlingame High School. In 1947, Dietrich and sister Janet entered the inaugural Chico-to-San Mateo Air Race and took first place, defeating experienced men. Dietrich graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1949, with degrees in mathematics and psychology. After placing in other local races, the flying twins collected the second-place trophy in the 1951 All-Women's Transcontinental Air Race, known as the Powder Puff Derby. Dietrich worked for a time as a newspaper reporter for the Oakland Tribune, flying supersonic as a passenger in a fighter aircraft on a story assignment. She also became a commercial transport pilot, flying charter and ferry flights. In 1960, Dietrich and her sister were among a select group of female aviators invited to the Lovelace Clinic in Albuquerque, where experts had screened potential NASA astronauts.

The first Thai Olympic gold medalist was **Somluck Kamsing** (boxing, 1996), born 1973, known as \"The Ring Magician,\" and he was a flag bearer.

Reizenstein was a pupil of Solomon, Hindemith and Vaughan Williams. While there, Martin won many prestigious awards and prizes. He later studied under Lennox Berkeley, Richard Rodney Bennett and Louis Kentner. He went on to a dual career as both a pianist and composer. Among his compositions are four piano concertos. The Nine Orders of Angels, his third piano concerto, is dedicated to his wife, Julia, whilst his fourth is a dedicated concerto for youth orchestra. Through Streets Broad and Narrow for piano and chamber orchestra, a concerto for harp dedicated to the Irish harpist Andreja Maliř, a symphony, much chamber music including seven piano trios and over 250 songs. Major choral works include \\\"Thalassa\\\" and a Chamber of commerce commission to celebrate the millennium, In Dublin's Fair City. His music has been included on eight CDs, and his recordings for Hyperion Records include the complete piano music of the colourful 19th-century pianist and composer, Louis Moreau Gottschalk. One major interest is his passion for American music and he has given many first performances in the UK of works by William Schuman, Lukas Foss, Leonard Bernstein, and the first performance in Ireland of Samuel Barber's piano concerto. Martin's CD featuring the piano music of the English composer Billy Mayerl who died in 1959 was released in 2012 with volume 2 due for release in June 2015 by Somm Recordings. Martin's interest in art led to him gaining an Open University degree in art history in 2009. He is also an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Academy of Music in London and a member of Aosdana, Ireland's academy of creative artists. In 2012 he was awarded a professorship by the City University of Birmingham, England, for his outstanding contribution to the arts. Among his best known piano works are The Rainbow Comes And Goes and In a Thousand Valley's Far and Wide, both commissions from the GPA (now AXA) International Piano Competition in Dublin.

Just like Sanharib Malki, Jbari started his football career at local team SCUP Jette. Soon after, he went to the youth teams of Anderlecht. He made his début for the first team in 1995. Not getting too many chances at RSCA, Jbari decided to move to AA Gent, where he would only stay one year. During his period with Gent, Jbari would make his début as Red Devil. With this success, he went to Club Brugge, who were aiming more towards the top of the Belgian football competition. When his era at the blue and black side ended, Jbari decided to head for foreign football competitions. Troyes AC was Jbari's next team. He stayed there until the winter break of the 2001-02 season, as he went on loan to the Greek team Aris Thessaloniki F.C.. Jbari then returned to Troyes and stayed there for a 6 further months, until Ligue 2 side Grenoble Foot 38 bought him. But only six months later, Jbari would be an unattached football player. Jbari then had a successful test period with Cercle Brugge, who had just promoted to the Jupiler League, right before the 2003-04 season, a.o. impressing and scoring in a friendly against Sint-Truiden. Nevertheless, he would sign a contract for one year due to him being prone to injuries. Jbari would become top scorer of the team, and thus raising the interest of other teams. At the end of the season, Jbari decided to go back to his former team AA Gent, who had offered him a better contract than Cercle. However, his move was not as successful as it was the first time he went to Gent. Jbari left and went to La Louvière only one year later. Sadly for Jbari, the team went bankrupt.

A catcher, he appeared in 395 games in the Major Leagues over eight seasons (1960–67) for the New York Yankees, Cincinnati Reds, New York Mets, Milwaukee Braves and Pittsburgh Pirates. Gonder batted left-handed, threw right-handed, and was listed as 5 feet 10 inches (1.78 m) tall and 180 pounds (82 kg). He played for Baseball Hall of Fame manager Casey Stengel with both the Yankees (1960) and Mets (1963–65). He was born in Monticello, Arkansas, but attended McClymonds High School in Oakland, California, alma mater of Basketball Hall of Fame center Bill Russell, as well as two of Gonder's future MLB teammates, Frank Robinson and Vada Pinson. Gonder signed with Cincinnati in 1955 and began his 15-year professional career. Acquired by the Yankees' Triple-A Richmond Virginians affiliate in 1960, he made his MLB debut that September and hit a pinch home run at Yankee Stadium off Bill Monbouquette for his first big-league hit on September 30. He was a member of the Yankees for the first weeks of the 1961 season as a pinch hitter before being sent back to Richmond for the rest of the season. The Reds then reacquired Gonder in an off-season trade for pitcher Marshall Bridges. Assigned to the Triple-A San Diego Padres, Gonder led the 1962 Pacific Coast League in batting (.342) and runs batted in (116) and was named the PCL's most valuable player. He was recalled by Cincinnati that September, then spent the following four full seasons in the National League. Gonder batted over .300 in 1963 (.304) in part-time duty for the Reds and Mets, and was the Mets' regular catcher in 1964, starting behind the plate for 82 games and setting personal bests in home runs (seven) and runs batted in (35). Gonder reverted to part-time status in 1965, and for the remainder of his big-league career played behind regular catchers Chris Cannizzaro, Joe Torre and Jim Pagliaroni. He was sent to Triple-A in June 1967 and wrapped up his pro career in 1969. In the Majors, Gonder collected 220 hits, including 28 doubles, two triples and 26 home runs. Five of those home runs came as a pinch hitter.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "BaseballPlayer", "wiki_name": "Jesse_Gonder", "word_count": 375, "label": "Baseball Player", "people": "Jesse Gonder", "anonymized_text": "An individual was active in a professional sport for several years during the mid-20th century.

{"text": "Isambard Kingdom Brunel FRS (9 April 1806 – 15 September 1859), was an English mechanical and civil engineer who is considered \\\"one of the most ingenious and prolific figures in engineering history\\\", \\\"one of the 19th century engineering giants\\\", and \\\"one of the greatest figures of the Industrial Revolution, [who] changed the face of the English landscape with his groundbreaking designs and ingenious constructions\\\". Brunel built dockyards, the Great Western Railway, a series of steamships including the first propeller-driven transatlantic steamship and numerous important bridges and tunnels. His designs revolutionised public transport and modern engineering. Though Brunel's projects were not always successful, they often contained innovative solutions to long-standing engineering problems. During his career, Brunel achieved many engineering \\\"firsts\\\", including assisting in the building of the first tunnel under a navigable river and development of SS Great Britain, the first propeller-driven ocean-going iron ship, which was at the time (1843) also the largest ship ever built. Brunel set the standard for a well-built railway, using careful surveys to minimise grades and curves. This necessitated expensive construction techniques and new bridges and viaducts, and the two-mile-long Box Tunnel. One controversial feature was the wide gauge, a \\\"broad gauge\\\" of 7 ft 1⁄4 in (2,140 mm), instead of what was later to be known as 'standard gauge' of 4 ft 8 1⁄2 in (1,435 mm). Brunel astonished Britain by proposing to extend the Great Western Railway westward to North America by building steam-powered iron-hulled ships. He designed and built three ships that revolutionised naval engineering. In 2002, Brunel was placed second in a BBC public poll to determine the \\\"100 Greatest Britons\\\".

{"text": "Jay Maisel (born January 18, 1931, Brooklyn, New York) is an American photographer. His awards include the Art Directors Club Hall of Fame, the Lifetime Achievement Award of the American Society of Media Photographers, and the Infinity Award of the International Center of Photography. Maisel studied painting and graphic design at Manhattan's Cooper Union and at Yale University, and became a photographer in 1954. One of Maisel's most known images is his photograph of Miles Davis that appeared on the cover of Davis's album Kind of Blue. In 2009, Andy Baio created an image based on the original Kind of Blue album cover for the cover of a chiptune tribute album titled \\\"Kind of Bloop\\\". Attorneys representing Maisel demanded damages and that the resulting image be removed from the chiptune album, resulting in an out-of-court settlement of $32,500 from Baio. For 40 years Maisel lived with his family in the historic Germania Bank Building in lower Manhattan. Built in 1898, the 35,000-square-foot (3,300 m2) single-family mansion contains 72 rooms over six floors. Maisel purchased the building in 1966 for $102,000 when the neighborhood was in severe decline. The building's value was estimated at $30 to $50 million in 2008. New York Magazine called it \\\"maybe the greatest real-estate coup of all time.\\\" In February 2015 the Bank building was sold for $55 million to developer Aby Rosen. Maisel's new residence, a nearly 27-foot-wide townhouse at 177 Pacific Street in a Brooklyn historic district, is three stories high with a full, finished basement; it has six bedrooms, six full baths and two half baths and an elevator, over about 10,000 square feet of space.

The legal case involving another artist's tribute suggests the original work had significant cultural impact and copyright value. The property details suggest someone with substantial wealth, possibly from the art world or family money, who made strategic real estate investments.\n\n- **Deduction**: The most distinctive clue is the \"widely circulated image of a musician that appeared on a popular album\" with subsequent legal action over a tribute. This strongly points to the case involving the \"Nevermind\" album cover featuring the baby photograph, where the subject later sued Nirvana.

The \"baby in the water\" Nevermind album cover was photographed by Kirk Weddle, and the subject Spencer Elden later sued. However, the text describes the creator of the image, not the subject. The legal action involved the subject suing, not another artist creating a tribute. Let me refine:*\n\n**Revised Reasoning**:\n\nThe key album artwork clue likely refers to the \"Village People\" lawsuit where a photographer sued over Madonna's \"Vogue\" video referencing his album cover photography. The photographer was Firooz Zahedi, who shot the cover for Village People's \"Renaissance\" album, and Madonna's team referenced this in her \"Vogue\" artwork, leading to a settlement.\n\n**Corrected Top-10 Guesses**:\n\n1.
