After leaving Ireland Simms became an astronomical assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, under John Pond. He resigned his post on 31 October 1835, apparently having hoped to be awarded the post of First Assistant, for which he was \\\"quite incompetent\\\" in the words of Sir George Biddell Airy. He returned to his former occupation as a surveyor and civil engineer, visiting France with Richard Tappin Claridge, who in the 1830s patented the use of Seyssel asphalt in the UK, and later working with Claridge on the introduction of asphalt to Britain. The formation in 1838 of Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company (which ceased operating in 1917 ) \\\"gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry\\\". Simms' own efforts included writing a pamphlet promoting the use of Seyssel asphalt, based on an 1836 paper by geologist M. Rozet. In 1836 Simms joined the South Eastern Railway Company as a resident engineer and undertook a considerable number of works, including the construction of the Bletchingley and Saltwood tunnels. In 1846 the East India Company, having decided to construct railways in their territories, proposed to Simms that he become their consulting engineer in India. His health suffered from the climate and he spend some time in Mauritius before returning to duty where, among other work, he supervised a complete survey and mapping of the city of Calcutta which was principally carried out by local assistants.

{"text": "Philipp Veit (13 February 1793 – 18 December 1877) was a German Romantic painter. To Veit is due the credit of having been the first to revive the almost forgotten technique of fresco painting. Veit was born in Berlin, Prussia. He was the son of a banker Simon Veit and his wife Dorothea, daughter of Moses Mendelssohn, who subsequently left him to marry Friedrich Schlegel. Veit received his first art education in Dresden, where he was taught by Caspar David Friedrich, and Vienna. Although a prodigious talent when it came to drawing, Veit was not comfortable with oil painting. Therefore, in Vienna he took to working with watercolor. In Vienna, he made the acquaintance of Schlegel, and through him came to know several Viennese Romantics, one of whom was the poet and novelist Joseph von Eichendorff. He was strongly influenced by, and joined, the Nazarene movement in Rome, where he worked for some years before moving to Frankfurt. Veit participated in the struggle against Napoleon in 1813-14, returning to Berlin for a short period. In 1815, he finished the Virgin with Christ and St John, a votive painting for the church of St James in Heiligenstadt, Vienna. The painting was inspired by the style of Pietro Perugino and Raphael. In Frankfurt, where his most important works are preserved at the Städel, he was active from 1830 to 1843 as director of the art collections and as professor of painting. From 1853 till his death in 1877 he held the post of director of the municipal gallery in Mainz. Like his fellow Nazarenes he was more draughtsman than painter, and though his sense of colour was stronger than that of Overbeck or Cornelius, his works are generally more of the nature of coloured cartoons than of paintings in the modern sense. Veit's principal work is the large fresco of The Introduction of Christianity into Germany by St Boniface, at the Städel. In the Frankfurt Cathedral is his Assumption, while the Alte Nationalgalerie of Berlin has his painting of The Two Marys at the Sepulchre. An example of his romantic work is Germania, a national personification of Germany, located in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum of Nuremberg.

Instead, the description matches **Fabio Casartelli** (Italian, born 1970), who died in a crash—not a coma. However, the coma detail is iconic for **Jean-François Bernard** (born 1962), who suffered heatstroke and collapsed after a time trial in the 1987 Tour, but he did not fall into a prolonged coma. The most famous coma incident in cycling involves **French cyclist Raymond Poulidor**? No—he never lapsed into a coma.

He was dehydrated and needed medical attention but not a coma.  \nLet's focus on the second major clue:  \n2. **Solo breakaway in late twenties, over 4 hours, parents watching for first time, win dedicated to father**. This is a legendary story in Tour de France history: In the 1995 Tour, **Laurent Jalabert**? No. Actually, the story fits **Richard Virenque** (born 1969) winning on Hautacam in 1994, but his parents were not mentioned as watching for first time.  \nI recall a famous stage win in the 1993 Tour de France by **Tony Rominger**? No, Swiss.  \nWait—the story of a French cyclist, born 1962, winning a stage solo after a long breakaway for his parents watching first time—that is **Luc Leblanc** (born 1966). Not 1962.  \nLet's search memory: There is a famous French cyclist, **Laurent Fignon** (born 1960), but he didn't have such a stage win for his parents.  \nActually, I think the description matches **Charly Mottet** (born 1962) — he had a famous win in 1987 Tour? Not a 4-hour solo.  \nWait—the most famous long solo breakaway in Tour de France history was by **Albert Londres**? No. Let's list known long breakaways: In 1955, **Jean Robic**? No. In 1995, **Jacky Durand**? Yes! Jacky Durand (born 1967) had a 232 km break in 1995, but he is not born in 1962.  \nBut the parents story—I recall a very emotional win dedicated to father by **Laurent Jalabert** in 1995 after his brother's death? No.  \nWait—I've got it: The story of a French cyclist born in 1962, who won a stage in the Tour de France with a long solo breakaway after his parents watched him for the first time, is **Marc Madiot**? No, he is older.  \nLet's check date: Born March 1962 — known French cyclists: **Jean-François Bernard** (born 1962, May 30), not March. **Charly Mottet** (born 1962, December 16). **Philippe Bouvatier**? Born 1964.  \nWait—there is a famous French cyclist born March 1962: **Laurent Biondi**? No.  \nActually, **Richard Virenque** is 1969.  \nI think the description is of **Jean-François Bernard** (born 1962). He did have a famous stage win in 1987 Tour de France on Mont Ventoux, but not a 4-hour solo.  \nBut the parents story—I recall a 1990s Tour de France stage where a French cyclist, **Nicolas Portal**? No.  \nWait—I found it: The story of a long solo breakaway for parents watching first time is famously attributed to **French cyclist Jacky Durand** (born 1967) in 1995, but his parents were not mentioned.  \nLet's reexamine: The text says \"In a later edition, the cyclist, then in their late twenties, participated in a stage where their parents were able to attend for the first time due to family caregiving responsibilities.\" This implies the cyclist was in late 20s in early 1990s if born 1962. So around 1990–1992.  \nI recall a famous stage in 1992 Tour de France: **Claudio Chiappucci**? Italian.  \nWait—the emotional dedication to father after long breakaway—this is ringing a bell for **Urs Zimmermann**? No.  \nActually, I think the story is about **Rolf Sørensen**? No, Danish.  \nLet's focus on French cyclists born in March 1962:  \n- **Laurent Fignon** (born 1960)  \n- **Charly Mottet** (born 1962, but December)  \n- **Jean-François Bernard** (born 1962, May)  \n- **Marc Madiot** (born 1959)  \n- **Philippe Bouvatier** (1964)  \nNone born in March.  \nWait—there is **Régis Clère** (born 1956).  \nMaybe the birth month is wrong in my memory.  \nBut the story is very specific: long solo breakaway (>4 hours), parents first time watching, win dedicated to father.  \nI recall a legendary Tour de France stage: 1993, stage 8, **Armand de las Cuevas**? No.  \nWait—I've got it: It's **Luc Leblanc** (born 1966) winning at Hautacam in 1994, but his parents were not mentioned.  \nActually, the story matches **Richard Virenque** (born 1969) winning at Hautacam in 1994, but again parents not highlighted.  \nLet's search famous solo breakaways: In 1987 Tour, **Jean-François Bernard** won a long time trial, not a breakaway.  \nI think the text might be describing **Charly Mottet** (born 1962) in 1987 Tour? He didn't have a solo breakaway win.  \nWait—I recall a very emotional stage win dedicated to father: **Laurent Fignon** in 1984? No.  \nActually, the story is famous: In 1995 Tour de France, **Laurent Jalabert** won stage 15 after a long breakaway and dedicated it to his father? No, that was **Richard Virenque** in 1997?  \nI'm mixing up.  \nLet's check online memory: There's a well-known story of French cyclist **Jacky Durand** (born 1967) winning stage 9 of 1995 Tour in a long breakaway, and he said his parents were watching for first time. Yes! That's it! But he is not born 1962.  \nSo either the birth year is wrong or the cyclist is not Jacky Durand.  \nGiven the birth year 1962, the closest match is **Charly Mottet** or **Jean-François Bernard**, but neither had such a famous parental story.  \nWait—there is **French cyclist Philippe Louviot**? Born 1964.  \nI think the most likely is **Jacky Durand** (born 1967) but the text says 1962, so maybe a misprint.  \nGiven the constraints, I'll assume the text refers to **Jacky Durand**-like story but birth year 1962, so perhaps **Charly Mottet** is the best match among 1962-born.  \nBut the parental story is unique to Jacky Durand.  \nLet's list possible French cyclists born 1962:  \n1. Charly Mottet  \n2. Jean-François Bernard  \n3. Philippe Bouvatier  \n4. Laurent Biondi  \n5. Pascal Poisson  \nNone have the exact parental story.  \nGiven the public figure inference, the story is so specific that it must be **Jacky Durand**, but birth year mismatch.  \nMaybe the birth year is 1967, not 1962.  \nIf I strictly follow the text (born 1962), the closest is Charly Mottet, but no coma story.  \nWait—the coma: There is a famous case of French cyclist **Raymond Poulidor**? No.  \nActually, the collapse and coma might refer to **Jean-François Bernard**'s collapse on Ventoux in 1987, but he didn't go into coma.  \nI think the coma story is from a different cyclist—maybe **Tom Simpson** (British).  \nGiven the contradictions, I'll infer the most likely based on the parental story: It's Jacky Durand, but since birth year is given as 1962, I'll adjust to closest 1962-born with similar achievements.  \n\n**Top-5 Guesses**:  \n1.

Known as \\\"Buddy\\\" Raines, in the 1930s he began working as a stable hand and became an exercise rider, notably for the U.S. Racing Hall of Fame colt Cavalcade. He went on to condition racehorses for 65 years, working primarily on the U.S. East Coast and was a regular at Delaware Park and Monmouth Park Racetracks. Buddy Raines met with his greatest success training horses for Donald Ross's Brandywine Stable. He had great success with Cochise, winning several important races between 1949 and 1951, including the Massachusetts and Arlington Handicaps and the Saratoga Cup and set or equaled track records at Suffolk Downs and Delaware Park. In July 1950, with the colt Greek Song, Raines won the Arlington Classic, a race that at the time was one of the most important in America. As a stallion, Greek Song was mated to the mare Lucy Lufton, a granddaughter of the great sire Nearco. Their union produced Greek Money who would give Buddy Raines his most important win in 1962 when the chestnut colt won a U.S. Triple Crown race, the Preakness Stakes. In 1966, Raines conditioned Open Fire to a champion season. The daughter of Brandywine Stable's Cochise, Open Fire won the Delaware Handicap, the Spinster Stakes as well as the Diana Handicap en route to being voted Co-U.S. Champion Older Mare. On a personal basis, Buddy Raines played a major role in the rearing of his grandsons John and Mike Luzzi who both became jockeys. One of the family's great memories came in 1991 when the eighty-year-old Raines saddled Timely Warning and watched as grandson Mike Luzzi won the Maryland Million Classic and the Brooklyn Handicap. In 1996 Monmouth Park began awarding the Virgil W. Raines Distinguished Achievement Award which honors an owner or trainer who has shown a dedication to the sport of Thoroughbred racing through exemplary conduct demonstrating professionalism and integrity.

Given the constraints, the most likely is **Abelardo Morell**, but he was born in Cuba. The evidence points overwhelmingly to **Catherine Opie** (born 1961, too young).  \n\nAfter careful analysis, the only photographer who fits all criteria is **John Baldessari** (born 1931, not Massachusetts).

Mitter was born in Schönlinde (Krásná Lípa) in Czechoslovakia, but his family was expelled from there, to Leonberg near Stuttgart. After racing motorbikes, he switched to Formula Junior, becoming the best German driver with 40 victories. In addition, he sold two-stroke engines for FJ. In 1963, Mitter won the Formula Junior Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring. Mitter also participated in seven Grands Prix, debuting on 23 June 1963. He scored a total of three championship points in his home 1963 German Grand Prix with an old Porsche 718 from 1961. Impressed by this, Team Lotus gave him a chance in the following years. In sportscar racing and hillclimbing for Porsche, he scored many wins, e.g. the 1966-1968 European Hillclimb Championships against Ferrari, the 1968 24 Hours of Daytona (Porsche 907) and the 1969 Targa Florio (Porsche 908) as his final major win. Due to the long Nürburgring track, it was possible to take part in the German Grand Prix with Formula 2 cars that were classified in their own contest. Mitter was killed there at Schwedenkreuz while practising for the 1969 German Grand Prix with BMW's 269 F2 project.

{"text": "Charles Crupelandt (23 October 1886, Wattrelos, Nord - 18 February 1955, Roubaix) was a French professional road bicycle racer. He won stages in the Tour de France, but his biggest successes were the 1912 and 1914 Paris–Roubaix. The last cobbled section (300m) of the race, just before the velodrome, is named Espace Charles Crupelandt. In 1912 Charles Crupelandt became the subject of a painting by the Cubist artist and theorist Jean Metzinger. Au Vélodrome, also known as At the Cycle-Race Track and Le cycliste, illustrates the final meters of the Paris–Roubaix race and portrays its 1912 winner. Metzinger’s painting was the first in Modernist art to represent a specific sporting event and its champion. He incorporated into the painting his concepts of multiple perspective, simultaneity, and time, according to his belief that the fourth dimension was crucial to the new art that could compete with the classical French tradition. The painting was acquired by Peggy Guggenheim in 1945 and is now permanently on view in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection museum in Venice. Crupelandt went to war and returned a hero, with the Croix de Guerre. Three years into peace, however, he fell foul of the law and was found guilty. The Union Vélocipédique banned him for life, possibly at the urging of rivals in cycling. Crupelandt raced again but with an unofficial cycling association, with which he won national championships in 1922 and 1923.

Winning twice in the 1910s aligns with several cyclists of that period.  \n- **Named race segment:** Paris–Roubaix has iconic sectors named after cyclists (e.g., \"Secteur Pavé Charles Crupelandt\"), but only a few early winners received this honor.  \n- **Cubist painting:** The reference to an early Cubist painting depicting a cyclist in competition is highly specific. The painting *\"The Cyclist\"* (1912) by French Cubist artist Albert Gleizes fits this description—it portrays a cyclist in the Paris–Roubaix race, using multiple perspectives to show motion, and is held in the Musée National d'Art Moderne (Centre Pompidou, Paris). This painting is recognized as one of the first modernist works to depict a specific athlete.  \n- **Military service and ban:** The cyclist served with distinction in WWI (e.g., receiving the Croix de Guerre) but was later banned for life by the French cycling union (U.V.F.), likely for professionalism disputes or unauthorized racing. Despite the ban, they won national championships in the early 1920s via alternative circuits (e.g., \"Bol d'Or\" events).  \n- **Health and death:** The mid-1950s death and health struggles match historical accounts of cyclists from that generation.  \n\nThe combination of a Cubist painting, Paris–Roubaix wins, a named sector, a post-WWI ban, and national titles in the 1920s points strongly to **Charles Crupelandt**—a French cyclist who won Paris–Roubaix in 1912 and 1914, had a sector named after him (\"Secteur Pavé Charles Crupelandt\"), was painted by Gleizes, served in WWI, was banned in 1919, and won the French national stayer championship in 1922.  \n\n---\n\n**Top-5 Guesses:**  \n1.

{"text": "Sir Bradley Marc Wiggins, CBE (born 28 April 1980) is a British professional road and track racing cyclist who rides for the UCI Continental team WIGGINS. Nicknamed \\\"Wiggo\\\", he began his cycling career on the track, but has made the transition to road cycling and is one of the few cyclists to gain significant elite level success in both those forms of professional cycling. He is the only rider to have combined winning both World and Olympic championships on both the track and the road, as well as winning the Tour de France, and holding the iconic track hour record. In addition, he has worn the leader's jersey in each of the three Grand Tours of cycling and as of 2016 holds the world record in team pursuit. The son of the Australian cyclist Gary Wiggins, Wiggins was born to a British mother in Ghent, Belgium, and raised in London from the age of two. He competed on the track from the early part of his career until 2008. Between 2000 and 2008 he won ten medals at the track world championships, of which six were gold: three in the individual pursuit, two in the team pursuit and one in the madison. His first Olympic medal was a silver in the team pursuit in Sydney 2000, before winning three medals including the gold in the individual pursuit at the Athens 2004, and two golds in the individual and team pursuit at the Beijing 2008. On the road, Wiggins turned professional in 2001, but made it his focus from 2008. Initially viewed as a time trial specialist and as a rouleur, he showed his ability in stage races when he came fourth in the 2009 Tour de France; he was later promoted to third after Lance Armstrong's results were annulled in 2012. He signed with the newly formed Team Sky in 2010, and in 2011 he claimed his first victory in a major stage race in the Critérium du Dauphiné, as well as finishing third in the Vuelta a España. In 2012, Wiggins won the Paris–Nice, the Tour de Romandie, the Critérium du Dauphiné, and became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France and the time trial at the Olympic Games. In 2014 he won gold in the time trial at the road world championships, and founded the WIGGINS cycling team. Wiggins returned to the track at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and in June 2015 he set a new hour record with a distance of 54.526 km (33.881 mi). In 2016 he won a further world championship in the madison, and gold in the team pursuit at the Olympics, his fifth successive medal winning appearance at the Games. Wiggins was awarded a CBE in 2009.

He currently plays for the Guerreros de Oaxaca of the Mexican League Rosario was originally signed as an amateur free agent by Toronto on January 11, 1999. Rosario missed all of 2003 recuperating from Tommy John surgery. Throughout the minors, Rosario showed flashes of excellence, but has been inconsistent. Rosario, a former starter, was converted to the bullpen in mid-2005. His MLB debut came with the Blue Jays in a relief appearance against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim on May 6, 2006, pitching a hitless 8th inning while walking one and striking out one. His first MLB win came on May 10, 2006, with the Toronto, against the Oakland Athletics. He pitched a scoreless 5th and 6th inning, giving up only two hits while striking out three and not giving up a single walk. Out of 31 pitches thrown, 22 were strikes. Rosario made his first, and to date only, major league start August 5, 2006, going three innings for the Blue Jays against the Chicago White Sox. He threw 71 pitches in his first start, including 41 strikes. He struck out two, walked two, and gave up five hits, three runs, all of them earned. Rosario was acquired by the Philadelphia Phillies on April 5, 2007, for cash considerations. He appeared in 23 games with the Phillies that year. He was injured in June, then spent some time with the Clearwater Threshers on a rehab assignment.

The failed renomination and convention participation hint at a Republican or Democrat during a turbulent political era (e.g., Progressive Era).

Grosvenor** of Ohio (born 1833, died 1917—timeline slightly off) or **Robert R. Hitt** of Illinois (no such tragedy). After cross-referencing, the tragedy closely matches **John L. Sheppard** of Texas (not Midwest) or **William P. Hepburn** of Iowa (no tragedy), but the household accident is key. The only Midwestern Representative with a documented accident killing his first wife and children was **John H.

He trained for two of the most successful owner-breeders in British racing at the time, Lord Derby and HH Aga Khan III, and was British flat racing Champion Trainer on eight occasions. Frank Butters was born in Vienna, Austria, in 1878 while his father Joseph Butters was training racehorses there. He was educated in Britain but returned to Austria as an assistant to his father. He was interned in Austria during World War I and trained in Italy after the war. In 1926 he returned to Britain to start a four-year contract as Lord Derby's trainer at Stanley House stables in Newmarket in succession to George Lambton. He trained a number of Classic winners for the Earl and also trained for other owners, winning the Epsom Oaks in 1927 for the Earl of Durham. In 1930 Lord Derby terminated Butters' employment but he set up as a public trainer and when the Aga Khan split with Dick Dawson, Butters took over as his trainer. He trained for the Aga Khan until forced to retire after a serious bicycle accident in 1949. In that period he trained nine Classic winners for the Aga Khan including Mahmoud, who won the 1936 Epsom Derby in a then-record time, and the unbeaten 1935 Triple Crown winner Bahram. He also trained the Epsom Oaks winner Steady Aim for Sir Alfred Butt, plus three winners of the Irish Derby for the Aga Khan and won the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe with Migoli in 1948. His win with Migoli in the \\\"Arc\\\" was the first for an English-trained horse since 1923 and there would not be another until 1971.

It was Josephine Baker who encouraged Belew to work as a costume designer. While he made costumes for plays, musicals, operas, ballets, TV specials and TV series, Belew is particularly famous for the stage outfits he made for Elvis. He created the tight-fitting black leather outfit that Elvis wore in the 1968 NBC Comeback Special, and the bell-bottomed jumpsuit outfits with high Napoleonic collars, pointed sleeve cuffs, wide belts and capes, decorated with gems, metal and rhinestone studding, sequins and embroidery. Belew also designed the suit Elvis is wearing on the famous photo of President Nixon and him in the Oval Office, a velveteen outfit originally designed for Elvis to use in his Las Vegas shows. Of the collars, Belew has explained that they were inspired by Napoleon's wardrobe and that he chose them because they would frame and draw attention to Presley's face. In an interview Belew explained why most of the jumpsuits were white: The lighting [in Las Vegas] was still in its early stages. And we found that the color that worked the best was white. It allowed them to change the colors on him, where as black would absorb all the color. And it was hard to highlight him. And we experimented with blue which was one of his favorite colors. Red. But it just ended up that white was the best thing and, of course, you know, you want the star to be the person, you know, and not the wardrobe. During the 1970s Belew designed Elvis' offstage wardrobe, as well. Among the most famous of Belew's Elvis jumpsuits are the American Eagle (created for the 1973 Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite) and the Peacock (first worn at the Forum in Los Angeles in 1974, and later seen on the cover to the 1975 album Promised Land). In 2008 the Peacock suit was sold at an online auction for $300,000. This made it the most expensive piece of Elvis memorabilia sold at auction. The elaborate embroidery, which was getting a more prominent role on the jumpsuits in 1974–1977, was the work of Gene Doucette. In the 1970's, Bill Belew was in big demand. He was busy doing television shows and movies, so he would give Gene the blank suits and Gene would design them himself. Gene designed most of the suits from 1972 until Elvis' death. He designed the more elaborate suits such as the Aloha, Peacock, Sundial, Tiger, and American Eagle.

Alternatively, **Michael Boogerd** fits some clues (Dutch, classic wins) but not the 1970s pro timeline.  \n\nReconciling the Olympics clue: The only Dutch male cyclist with Olympic appearances in the 1990s and 2000s who turned pro in the 1970s is **Bart Brentjens** (born 1968), who turned pro in 1990—not the 1970s. This suggests the “early 1970s” may refer to his birth decade, not his pro career. If so, Brentjens (mountain biker) won gold in 1996 and competed in 2000/2004 Olympics, but he didn’t win Paris–Roubaix.  \n\nThus, the text likely contains a composite of traits from multiple riders, but the strongest match for the classic win/record/management is **Joop Zoetemelk**, with other names fitting partially.  \n\n**Top-5 Guesses**:  \n1.

{"text": "Giovanni Domenico Ferretti (Giandomenico), also called Giandomenico d'Imola (15 June 1692 – 18 August 1768) was an Italian Rococo style painter from Florence. According to the contemporary Giovanni Camillo Sagrestani, Ferretti was a pupil of the Bolognese painter Giuseppe Maria Crespi. Others say he worked with painter Giovanni Gioseffo dal Sole. He returned to Florence with a letter of recommendation of Cardinal Gozzadini seeking patronage from Cosimo III de' Medici. He found work in the studio of Tommaso Redi and Sebastiano Galeotti. He travelled to Bologna to work under Felice Torelli and then resettled in Florence in 1715. Ferretti soon joined the Florentine Accademia del Disegno, where he later taught painting but also designed tapestries for the Medici. He found abundant patronage in fresco painting for the Florentine Abbey (Badia Fiorentina), the Chapel of San Giuseppe in the Duomo, and the altar and cupola of the Church of San Salvatore al Vescovo. One of his most important works was the decoration of the ceiling of the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, since lost in a fire. Ferretti's fresco style was influenced by Sebastiano Ricci's lively, colourful, and pastel-hued frescoes in the Palazzo Marucelli-Fenzi.

The individual’s career includes a science degree, WWI service as a temporary officer in a yeomanry unit followed by a commission and transfer to a service corps, postwar engineering practice with his father, WWII service in an unpaid technical advisory unit of the Territorial Army, retirement from practice in the early 1950s after his father’s death, and later election as president of the same institution his father had led.  \n\nKey clues:  \n- Father was a civil engineering pioneer in sanitation and a past president of a major institution (likely the Institution of Civil Engineers, ICE).  \n- The individual followed his father into engineering practice and later became ICE president.  \n- Scottish heritage, yeomanry and service corps background in WWI, unpaid technical advisory role in WWII.  \n- Timeline fits a birth around the 1880s–1890s, with presidency likely in the 1950s or 1960s.  \n\nThe father’s sanitation work and ICE presidency strongly point to **Sir William Halcrow** (father: Thomas Meik, also a notable engineer, but not a sanitation pioneer) or a figure like **James Williamson** — but the father’s profile matches **Sir Alexander Binnie** (sanitation, ICE President 1905) or **Sir John Wolfe-Barry** (though not specifically sanitation). However, the son’s career aligns best with **Sir William Halcrow** (born 1883, Scottish, father Thomas Meik was civil engineer, Halcrow took over his firm, served in both wars, ICE President 1950–51). But here, the father is noted as sanitation pioneer and ICE president two decades before the son — Thomas Meik was ICE President 1925–26, not two decades before Halcrow’s 1950–51 presidency.  \n\nAlternatively, **Sir Robert Wynne-Edwards** (father was Sir John Wynne-Edwards, ICE President 1935–36) doesn’t fit the sanitation clue. The father’s early sanitation work fits **Sir John Taylor** (ICE President 1945–46) or **Sir Alexander Gibb** (father Easton Gibb not sanitation). Actually, a strong candidate is **David Anderson** (son of Sir William Anderson, ICE President 1926–27, known for sanitation/water works) — David Anderson was born 1887, Scottish, WWI service in Royal Engineers, WWII in Territorial Army, ICE President 1951–52, took over father’s firm, retired early 1950s. This matches nearly all details.  \n\nChecking: Sir William Anderson (1844–1900) was a Scottish civil engineer known for waterworks/sanitation, but he died early (not two decades before son’s presidency). Actually David Anderson’s father was **Sir William H. Anderson** (engineer, but not ICE President) — correction: Sir William Anderson (not same) — maybe confusion.  \n\nBetter fit: **Sir Hubert Shirley-Smith** (father Sir William Shirley-Smith? Not sanitation).  \n\nActually, known figure: **Sir Thomas (Tom) Longbotham**? Not matching.  \n\nGiven constraints, the most consistent match is **Sir David Anderson** (1887–1963) — father was James G. Anderson? Not sanitation pioneer.  \n\nWait — known Scottish civil engineer with father in sanitation: **Sir Charles Brand** (father David Brand, not famous).  \n\nBut prominent ones: **Sir William Halcrow** fits except father’s sanitation link weak.  \n\nGiven public records, the father’s sanitation and ICE presidency points to **Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice**? No — father William Fitzmaurice not ICE President.  \n\nThe only father–son ICE Presidents are:  \n- James Brunlees (President 1882–83) and Sir James Brunlees (not son? Actually same person confusion)  \n- Sir John Hawkshaw (1871–72) and son John Clarke Hawkshaw (1901–02) — but father not sanitation.  \n- Sir Alexander Binnie (1905–06) and son William Binnie? Not ICE President.  \n\nActually, father Sir William Binnie? Not.  \n\nBut known: **Sir John H. G. Binnie** (father Sir Alexander Binnie, known for sanitation as London’s water engineer) — but John Binnie born 1917, too late.  \n\nGiven timeline, the described engineer is likely **Sir William Halcrow**, though father’s sanitation link is weak.  \n\n---\n\n**Top-5 Guesses:**  \n1.

This strongly points to U.S. reengagement with Myanmar (Burma), as diplomatic relations were normalized in 2012 after decades of sanctions, and the U.S. reopened its embassy there. The role of \"Special Representative\" aligns with the position of Special Representative and Policy Coordinator for Burma, established around that time. The diplomat is a career foreign service officer with decades of experience, prior service as a deputy chief of mission elsewhere, and a military background as a commissioned officer after graduating from a military academy. These clues narrow it down to individuals with a unique blend of Foreign Service and military training, likely from West Point or another service academy. The most probable candidate is Derek Mitchell, who was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Myanmar in 2012 (and served as Special Representative), but he did not have a military academy background. Alternatively, other diplomats like Michael J. Murphy (who had a Navy background) or W. Patrick Murphy (a Foreign Service Officer with military experience) fit some criteria, but the specific role and timing suggest a focus on Myanmar. The military academy detail is rare among senior diplomats, pointing to figures like James F. Jeffrey (West Point, but his roles don't match) or Lawrence J. Korb (military background, but not a Myanmar specialist). After cross-referencing, the description best fits **W. Patrick Murphy**, who served as Deputy Chief of Mission in Cambodia (the \"another nation\" clue) and was a Navy officer after graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy, though his appointment as Special Representative for Myanmar came later (2018).

{"text": "Christian Wilberg (20 November 1839 in Havelberg – 3 June 1882 in Paris) was a German painter. Wilberg was born in 1839 in Havelberg in the Margraviate of Brandenburg (nowadays Saxony-Anhalt) where he lived until 1861. He was originally a house painter before moving to Berlin where he studied painting at Eduard Pape's atelier. After 18 months, Pape suggested to Wilberg that he should study further with Paul Gropius, where he acquired a good knowledge of perspective and architecture. After finishing his apprenticeship under Oswald Achenbach's supervision in Düsseldorf in 1870, Wilberg traveled through Northern Germany and spent two years in Venice. Even after returning to Berlin, Wilberg continued visiting Italy as his favourite field of art was Italian architecture. Amongst his most important works in this field are his paintings of St Mark's Basilica in Venice and the Cappella Palatina in Palermo. In 1880, Wilberg painted a panorama of the Gulf of Naples for the Berlin Fishery exhibition, which gained him recognition amongst insiders. In the year before he went on a trip to Pergamon with the director of the Berlin Collection of Classical Antiquities. It was here that Wilberg made a series of sketches of the Acropolis which he later utilised for paintings. He acquired a large knowledge in ancient architecture and used this to conceive reconstructions of Roman buildings – one of which was later hung in Berlin's famous Café Bauer. Wilberg's last major project was a great panorama of the Baths of Caracalla which he created for the Berlin Hygiene exhibition of 1882. This last major work was incinerated when the exhibition hall caught fire and Wilberg only had time to save a few paintings and drawings. After the fire, Wilberg travelled to France in the company of Werner Ludwig Pietsch in order to paint in Sedan; on his way there, he got ill while visiting Paris. He died there shortly afterwards. In October and November 1882 a special exhibition including more than 677 of Wilberg's works was held in Berlin's National Gallery. Some of the paintings from this exhibition, Villa Mondagrone and a number of oil sketches in watercolour and pencil drawings, were transferred to the National Gallery's ownership. In 1883, the Old Masters Picture Gallery in Dresden was presented with Memento Mori, one of Wilberg's motifs of the Sabini Mountains in Italy.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Painter", "wiki_name": "Christian_Wilberg", "word_count": 388, "label": "Painter", "people": "Christian Wilberg", "anonymized_text": "A German painter (born 20 November 1839 – died 3 June 1882) began his career in his hometown before relocating to a major city to study at a local atelier.

Their cooking style blends contemporary Latin American cuisine with a diverse cultural heritage, suggesting a background that may include influences from countries like Peru, Mexico, or Brazil, combined with other global elements. The mention of opening a restaurant in the mid-2010s with a colleague, followed by a critically acclaimed cookbook focused on simple, high-quality ingredients, points to someone who has leveraged media presence into culinary entrepreneurship. The cookbook’s commercial success as a top seller on platforms like Amazon narrows it to public figures with significant international reach. Social media prominence further supports this, as many modern chefs build brands through digital engagement. Specific clues like \"official chef of a major television network\" and \"co-presenter on a morning program\" strongly hint at roles such as those on \"Today\" (NBC) or \"Good Morning America\" (ABC), while the Latin American fusion style and cultural heritage are hallmarks of chefs like Marcus Samuelsson (though he is older) or newer stars like Chef Palak Patel (but she lacks the TV network role). The timeline and achievements best match a chef like **Carla Hall** (born 1964, too old) or **Michael Symon** (born 1969, too old), but the age and Latin American focus point to younger, rising figures.

He is the uncle of fellow footballer Ian Stringfellow. Stringfellow began his career at Mansfield Town whom he joined as a schoolboy in 1957. He was a star in Mansfield's youth team, and signed a professional contract in February 1960, shortly after his 17th birthday. He made his first-team debut six months later, playing as an outside-left in the game against Rochdale on 30 August 1960. Despite his young age, Stringfellow remained a regular in the Mansfield Town side, and scored 12 goals in 65 appearances for the Stags, before moving to Leicester City for £25,000 in January 1962 – the highest transfer fee ever paid for an 18-year-old at the time. By his second season at Filbert Street, Stringfellow was a regular in the Leicester side. He was a member of the Leicester side that lost against Manchester United in the 1963 FA Cup Final, and scored one of the goals when the Foxes won the League Cup the following season with a 4–3 aggregate win against Stoke City. In 1968, Stringfellow suffered a serious cartilage injury, and was never the same player. Nevertheless, he remained on Leicester's books, mostly in a reserve role, until 1975 when he quit the professional game and finished his career with non-league Nuneaton Borough.

The individual also established a philanthropic foundation with a spouse in the 1950s focused on international issues, held leadership roles in engineering societies, and was a distinguished alumnus who contributed significantly to their alma mater—including a hydraulics laboratory renamed in their honor.  \n\nKey clues:  \n- **Engineering consulting firm founded in late 1930s**: This suggests a firm like \"Bechtel\" (founded earlier, 1898) or \"CH2M Hill\" (founded 1946), but the timeline and family involvement point to \"Harza Engineering\" (founded 1920, but major growth later) or \"TAMS\" (Tippetts-Abbett-McCarthy-Stratton, founded 1940s). However, the office furniture company co-founding is critical.  \n- **Office furniture manufacturer**: The only major U.S. office furniture company co-founded by an engineer in the mid-1940s is **Herman Miller** (founded earlier, 1905) or **Steelcase** (1912), but neither fits an engineer founder in the 1940s. However, **Haworth** (1948) was founded by G. W. Haworth, who was not an engineer. This mismatch suggests the \"office furniture\" company might be misinterpreted—or it could refer to **Knoll** (founded 1938, co-founded by Hans Knoll, whose wife Florence Knoll was a designer). Hans Knoll (1914–1955) was not an engineer and died in 1955, so the timeline is wrong.  \n- **Philanthropic foundation in 1950s for international issues**: This aligns with foundations like the \"Rockefeller Foundation\" (1913) or \"Ford Foundation\" (1936), but those are earlier. A 1950s foundation started by an engineer-couple points to something like the \"Mott Foundation\" (1926, earlier) or \"Hewlett Foundation\" (1966, later).  \n- **Hydraulics laboratory renamed in their honor**: This is a strong clue—the renaming of a university hydraulics lab after an engineer-alumnus suggests major contributions to hydraulic engineering.  \n\nThe most consistent figure matching all clues is **John R. Freeman** (1855–1932), but his dates are wrong. Alternatively, **Abel Wolman** (1892–1989) was a sanitary engineer, not an entrepreneur.  \n\nHowever, the description fits **William R. \"Bill\" Hewlett** (1913–2001) or **David Packard** (1912–1996) in some aspects (engineering, philanthropy), but they founded HP (1939) and their foundation (1964), not office furniture.  \n\nThe only figure matching the engineering firm, office furniture, and philanthropy is **Harry B. \"H.B.\" Reese**? No, he was a candy inventor.  \n\nWait—the office furniture company might be **Herman Miller**, but its key figures were D.J. De Pree (1919) and later Hugh De Pree. Not an engineer.  \n\nGiven the constraints, the most plausible candidate is **R. Buckminster Fuller** (1895–1983)—but he was not an engineer by training, and his timeline is off.  \n\nAfter cross-referencing, the description best matches **Walter H. \"Walt\" Braithwaite**? No, he was a Boeing engineer (1945–2021).  \n\nThe hydraulics lab honor is the strongest clue: **Alden Research Laboratory** at WPI was renamed after **John R. M. Alden**? Not quite.  \n\nActually, the figure is likely **John S. Eastwood** (1857–1924)—but dates wrong.  \n\nGiven the evidence, the top match is **Charles T. Main** (1856–1945)—but dates wrong.  \n\nThe only engineer-entrepreneur who co-founded a major office furniture company is **Hugh De Pree** (1915–1990), but he was not an engineer.  \n\nThis puzzle is tricky—but the most likely candidate based on engineering firm + office furniture + philanthropy is **Willis H. Carrier** (1876–1950)—but he founded Carrier Corp.

Freeman** (hydraulics lab at MIT), but dates wrong.  \n\nWait—the alma mater honor and hydraulics lab suggest a graduate of **University of Michigan** or **Cornell**. The **DeFrees Hydraulics Laboratory** at University of Michigan is named after **Joseph DeFrees**? Not a perfect match.  \n\nGiven the evidence, the most plausible candidate is **William M. \"Bill\" Hall**? No.  \n\nAfter re-evaluating, the figure is likely **Samuel C. \"Sam\" Flo**? No.  \n\nI conclude the description matches **Irving Porter Church**? No.  \n\nGiven the clues, the top guess is **John R.

Instead, it fits **Billy Birmingham** (b. 1953), but he's slightly older. The most plausible candidate is **Steve Vizard** (b. 1956), but he didn't have a manual labor background.  \n- **Highest-selling comedy recording in Australia**: This is a crucial clue. The best-selling comedy album in Australian history is **\"The Twelve Man\"** by Billy Birmingham, but he is not known for manual labor. Another record-holder is **\"The Wogs Out of Work\"** by Nick Giannopoulos (b. 1963), but it's a stage show, not a solo recording.  \n- **Co-wrote and starred in a film based on their experiences**: This matches **\"The Castle\"** co-writer and star **Rob Sitch** (b. 1962), but he is not primarily a stand-up comedian.  \n- **Live specials, box set, documentary, and panel shows**: This describes **Jimeoin** (b. 1966), who has multiple specials and TV appearances, but his background doesn't include manual labor.  \n- **Manual labor background**: This is a key trait of **Dave Hughes** (b. 1970), but he is too young. **Peter Helliar** (b. 1975) is also too young.  \n- **1990s comedy awards**: This could refer to the **MO Awards** or **ARIA Awards** for comedy. **Judith Lucy** (b. 1968) won awards, but she is female, and the text doesn't specify gender, but the manual labor clue suggests male.  \n- **Film co-written and starred in**: The most famous example is **\"The Castle\"** by Rob Sitch, but he didn't have a manual labor background. Another is **\"Crackerjack\"** by Mick Molloy (b. 1966), who co-wrote and starred in it, and he had a background in manual labor (worked as a lifeguard and in factories).

However, the Florida birth and family ties point to **Henry S. Clark** (trained Kelso) or **Frank Whiteley Jr.** (trained Ruffian), but Whiteley was born in Maryland.

The mid-1970s Outstanding Trainer award suggests a contemporary of **Laz Barrera** (trained Affirmed, Horse of the Year 1978–1979).

{"text": "John Engstead (22 September 1909 in California - 15 April 1983 in West Hollywood, California ) was an American photographer. Engstead began his career in 1926, when he was hired as an office boy by Paramount Pictures' head of studio publicity, Harold Harley. In 1927, Engstead pleased his boss by arranging a photo session for actress Clara Bow with photographer Otto Dyar using an outdoor setting which was unusual at that time. Engstead's creative direction of photographs of actress Louise Brooks led to a promotion to art supervisor, where he oversaw the production of Paramount's publicity stills. In 1932, due to a strike by photographers, Engstead assumed the position of studio portrait photographer, despite having never previously photographed anyone. Actor Cary Grant posed for his practice shots. He returned to his job as art supervisor after the strike was resolved. In 1941, Paramount Pictures fired Engstead, and Harper's Bazaar hired him for freelance advertising and portrait photography assignments. From 1941 to 1949, he took fashion photography assignments from numerous other magazines, including Collier's, Esquire, House Beautiful, Ladies Home Journal, Life, Look, Mademoiselle, McCall's, Vogue, and Women's Home Companion. In the 1940s, Engstead photographed many celebrities, including Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Maureen O'Hara and Shirley Temple. Unlike other photographers, he often shot his subjects at home or outdoors, and his portraits of Judy Garland in Carmel, California were particularly successful. During this decade, he built a studio in Los Angeles that became a gathering place for celebrities. Engstead continued to photograph movie stars and other celebrities through the 1950s (Marilyn Monroe) and 1960s. He produced promotional material for many television personalities, including Pat Boone, Carmel Quinn, Donna Reed, Ozzie and Harriet, Eve Arden, and Lucille Ball. He also shot cover photos for albums recorded by singers such as Peggy Lee and Connie Francis, as well as society portraits. His work extended into governmental figures in the 1950s, including then-Second Lady Pat Nixon.

Key clues include:  \n- Son of a Hall of Fame trainer.  \n- Took over a prominent stable in the late 1970s after his father’s health issues, remaining for about 15 years.  \n- Trained consecutive Champion horses and won major turf races, including international stakes.  \n- Died while working as a track official in a southern U.S. city and was buried in a central U.S. state.  \n\nThe father-son Hall of Fame trainer dynamic narrows candidates. The most famous example is the **Walmac International**-associated **John H. \"Jack\" Van Berg** (father: Marion H. Van Berg), but Jack was born in 1936 and died in 2017, so not a match.  \nA better fit is **Frank Whiteley Jr.**, but he was born in 1915.  \nThe description strongly matches **John J. \"Johnny\" Nerud**'s son **Jan Nerud**? No — Jan Nerud isn’t a Hall of Fame trainer.  \n\nActually, the father-son Hall of Fame trainers in U.S. racing are few:  \n1. **Jimmy Croll** (father not a Hall of Famer) — no.  \n2. **William \"Bill\" Mott** (born 1953) — no.  \n3. **John Gaver Sr.** and **John Gaver Jr.** — but Gaver Jr. was born 1938, died 2011.  \n4. **Horatio Luro** (father not a Hall of Famer) — no.  \n5. **H. Guy Bedwell** (father not Hall of Fame) — no.  \n\nBut the father being a Hall of Fame trainer and the son taking over a prominent stable in the late 1970s points strongly to **John R. S. \"John\" Fisher**? No.  \n\nLet’s check: **John H. \"Jack\" Van Berg**’s father **Marion H. Van Berg** is Hall of Fame, but Jack didn’t take over due to father’s health in late 1970s — Marion died in 1971.  \n\nAnother candidate: **Charles Whittingham** (born 1913) — no.  \n\nBut the clue about training consecutive Champions and major turf races internationally fits **Mack Miller**? No — father not Hall of Fame.  \n\nActually, the father-son Hall of Fame trainers are:  \n- **Harry Trotsek** (father not Hall of Fame) — no.  \n- **W. C. \"Woody\" Stephens** (no son trainer in Hall of Fame).  \n- **Lazaro S. Barrera** (son not Hall of Fame).  \n\nWait — the father being Hall of Fame and son taking over a stable in late 1970s — maybe **John J. \"Johnny\" Nerud** (Hall of Fame) and his son **Jan Nerud**? Jan wasn’t Hall of Fame.  \n\nBut the text says the described person is the *son* of a Hall of Fame trainer. So the described trainer is not necessarily in Hall of Fame himself.  \n\nGiven the specifics:  \n- Born 1940, died 2002 at 61.  \n- Took over father’s stable in late 1970s, trained 15 years there.  \n- Won major turf races, international stakes.  \n- Died while track official in a southern city, buried in central U.S.  \n\nThis matches **Joseph \"Joe\" H. Pierce Jr.**? No — not right dates.  \n\nActually, the most likely candidate is **John W. \"John\" H. Forbes**? No.  \n\nLet’s search known trainers born 1940, died 2002:  \n- **Robert \"Bobby\" Frankel** — born 1941, died 2009.  \n- **William \"Bill\" Shoemaker** — jockey, not trainer for this context.  \n- **John J. \"John\" Tammaro** — born 1941, died 2008.  \n\nBut father Hall of Fame trainer — only a few: **John Gaver Jr.** (born 1938, died 2011) — close but died at 73, not 61.  \n\nGiven the difficulty, the closest match in timeline and career is **John H. M. \"John\" Gosden**? No — British, born 1951.  \n\nBut the southern city death and central U.S. burial — maybe died in **Hot Springs, Arkansas** (Oaklawn Park) or **New Orleans** (Fair Grounds). Burial in central U.S. state like **Kentucky** (Calvary Cemetery) fits many trainers.  \n\nThe father-son Hall of Fame trainers in U.S.:  \n- **Marion H. Van Berg** (father, Hall of Fame) → **Jack Van Berg** (son, Hall of Fame) — but Jack died 2017.  \n- **John Gaver Sr.** (Hall of Fame) → **John Gaver Jr.** (Hall of Fame) — but Gaver Jr. died 2011.  \n- **Hirsch Jacobs** (Hall of Fame) → **John Jacobs** (trainer, not Hall of Fame) — John born 1925, died 1996.  \n\nGiven the 1940 birth, maybe **John Jacobs** is wrong.  \n\nActually, the only Hall of Fame father with a trainer son born 1940 is **Warren Stute**? No — father not Hall of Fame.  \n\nBut the text may refer to **John R. S. \"John\" Campo**? Born 1940, died 2005 — close but not 2002.  \n\nGiven the constraints, the most plausible candidate is **John J. \"Johnny\" Campo** — but he died 2005, not 2002.  \n\nBut if we strictly follow the birth 1940, death 2002, father Hall of Fame trainer, the only one is **John H. \"John\" J. L. \"Sonny\" Hine**? No — Hine born 1937, died 2000.  \n\nGiven the data, the best match is **John Gaver Jr.** except death year mismatch.  \n\nBut since this is inference, I’ll rank based on closeness to the description.  \n\n---\n\n**Top-5 Guesses**:  \n1.

The paper lasted for only three issues, however, and as such Hubrick's real legacy is derived from his photographic work.

Some carry scenes from the past. In the Hubrick panorama \\\"Goat Trail,\\\" you can see many goats walking the trail. In the panorama \\\"Taken From Nicolai Hill,\\\" you get a little snapshot of the Hubrick party at a photography shoot. You can see two riding horses, pack animals, and his guide. It is said that most of Mr. Hubrick's photographs were personally sold in or around McCarthy, Alaska circa 1916-1930.

Chitalada built a reputation as a Muay Thai in name Chaovalit Sithphrabrahma champion in Thailand before making the transition to professional boxing. After winning his first four professional fights, he challenged WBC Light flyweight Champion Jung-Koo Chang on 31 March 1984, losing a twelve-round decision. The name \\\"Sot Chitalada\\\" comes from the name of \\\"Muns Sorchitpatana\\\" a boxer, one of the managers of his support. But Sorchitpatana losing by Netrnoi Sor Vorasingh and likely to retire.

Later the rankings of the WBC was incorrect, Sorchitpatana became to Sot Chitlada eventually. Undaunted by the Chang loss, he won two more fights and a little over six months later shocked WBC and The Ring Flyweight Champion Gabriel Bernal, winning the world championships in his home country at Indoor Stadium Huamark, Bangkok. Chitalada is perhaps best-remembered for his fights with Bernal. The two met again twice in Bangkok. On 22 June 1985, Bernal fought Chitalada to a twelve-round draw, Chitalada keeping the titles. Bernal made another attempt eighteen months later, but on 10 December 1986 he lost another twelve-round decision to Chitalada. This was Bernal's final attempt at the Flyweight titles. Chitalada brought stability to the WBC and The Ring Flyweight titles, the six title holders prior to Bernal all losing the belts in their first defences, and Bernal losing his second defence. Following the first Bernal fight, Chitalada made six title defences (and won several non-title fights). During this run he defeated former world champions Charlie Magri and Freddy Castillo. He lost the titles on 24 July 1988, travelling to South Korea and losing a twelve-round decision to Yong-Kang Kim. After winning three more fights, Chitalada lured Kim for a rematch in his home country of Thailand. This time, it was Chitalada who came out on top, winning a twelve-round decision. Chitalada made four more title defences after he regained the titles. In his third defence, he made his second fight in the Western Hemisphere, defeating Richard Clarke by an eleventh-round knockout in Kingston, Jamaica, thus retaining his titles. For his fourth defence, he travelled to Seoul to avenge the only other loss in his career, to Jung-Koo Chang. Following the Chang fight, on 15 February 1991 Chitalada defended his titles against fellow-countryman Muangchai Kittikasem. This fight ended Chitalada's reign as he suffered his first knockout, Kittikasem stopping him in Round 6 to take the titles. Chitalada won two more fights before challenging Kittikasem to a rematch, but the result was the same, this time it ended in a ninth-round stoppage. That fight would be the last of Chitalada's career, he retired and never attempted a comeback. After retirement, he studied at the Faculty of Humanities, University of the Thai Chamber of Commerce.

Bekkering has several nicknames like Beeks, Daantje and Dikkie Dik. Her sister Eyelien is also a cyclist. Bekkering started her speed skating career aged 9 in 1986. She became Dutch junior short track champion in 1993 and 1994. In 1995 she became 6th at the Dutch senior shorttrack championships and fourth in 1996, which earned her a place in the Dutch team for the World Championships. In 1997 still as a short track speed skater she participated in the Noorder Rondritten, a natural ice speed skating race over 160 kilometres. She finished in third position in the ladies race and said to be totally exhausted after the race. She turned out to be a talented marathon speed skater and switched to that sport to leave the short track behind her and won her first race in 2000. In that same year she also finished in first position at the Dutch allround championships for students. 2001 was her definite breakthrough year as she finished second in the Essent Cup rankings, third on both the Dutch championships in artificial and nature tracks and first in the Three Days of the Greenery, the AGM Marathon in Mora, Sweden, and the Alternative Elfstedentocht in Kuopio, Finland. In 2002 she won both the Essent Cup and the sprint championship of the same cup as well as the Dutch championships on nature ice and two criteriums at the Weissensee in Austria. She finished fourth at the artificial track championships and second in the Greenery. She was second in the 2003 Essent Cup, but won the sprint competition and successfully defended her nature ice national title. She also won her second Three Days of the Greenery title and finished 5th at the Dutch artificial championships. In 2004 she became Dutch nature ice champion again as well as Essent Cup and sprinters competition winner. She finished third at the artificial championships this time, but managed to win 21 matches in total that year, including The Open Canadian Championships and the Alternative Elfstedentocht in Sylvan Lake, Canada. She retained all three of her titles (Essent Cup, sprint competition and nature ice title) in 2005 and finished in second position at the artificial track championships. In the Four Days of the Greenery she finished in second position. In 2006 she's dominating the Essent Cup 2006–07, winning five out of ten races so far. She also won the 2006 Five Days of the Greenery where she won four out of five races. She has been wearing the brussels sprout suit for a record of 12 days so far. As a cyclist she specialises in time trials and finished in 10th position at the Dutch time trial championships in 2001. A year later she reached the fourth spot and in 2005 she became fourth at the Dutch road race championships. In between she won an international road race in Pullheim. In total she did win 5 times the National championships on nature ice (2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007) and also two times the National Championships on artificial ice; 2008 (Assen) and 2009 (Heerenveen, together with her now husband Yoeri Lissenberg).Since her last win at the 10 November 2013 she is the all-time record-holder in marathon speedskating with 62 wins on artificial ice.

Claimed by the Boston Red Sox in Rule V from the Washington Nationals, Machado spent his first season at the Triple-A level with the Pawtucket Red Sox in 2005, being honored with the PawSox Rookie-of-the-Year Award. He was among Pawtucket's most consistent players all season, and finished 10th in the International League with a .300 batting average.

{"text": "Jonathan Hawkins (born 1 May 1983) is an English chess Grandmaster. He is the reigning British Chess Champion for 2015, having outscored David Howell, with whom he shared the title in 2014. Hawkins's chess career is unusual for the modern era in that he showed only modest ability as a child; his improvement from club player to International Master took place after he left full-time education, and while living in County Durham, far from traditional centres of chess activity.  About this sudden rise through the rankings, in his 2012 endgame book Amateur to IM, he notes that \\\"a careful study of the endgame sparked the biggest leap forward in my own game\\\". As well as his double British championship titles, tournament wins by Hawkins include the British Rapidplay Chess Championships in 2012 and 2014, making him (as of August 2015) the current British champion at both standard and rapid time limits. In 2013 he tied for first place in the 18th Vienna Open with Stanislav Novikov, Batuhan Dastan, Hagen Poetsch, Ralf Åkesson and Kacper Drozdowski. Hawkins was part of the English contingent at the rapidplay tournament of the 2014 London Chess Classic. His game against former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik at that event was notable for its simultaneous attacks against both castled kings, and for the \\\"exquisite Zugzwang\\\" to which Hawkins succumbed. Hawkins attained the FIDE titles of FIDE Master (FM) in 2008, International Master (IM) in 2010 and Grandmaster (GM) in 2014. His ascent from IM to GM was delayed two years by a lack of results against non-English players. This meant he became one of the highest-rated IMs in the world, outranking the majority of English GMs, and was the first winner of the British since Michael Hennigan in 1993 who had not earned the GM title by the end of the tournament.

{"text": "Asa Leonard Allen (January 5, 1891 – January 5, 1969) was an educator, attorney, and member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Louisiana. He served eight terms as a Democrat from 1937 to 1953, having represented the now defunct Eighth Congressional District, centered about Alexandria. Allen was born in a log cabin near Winnfield, the seat of Winn Parish, to Asa L. Allen and the former Sophronia Perkins. He was a younger brother of Governor Oscar Kelly Allen. He was educated in the Winn Parish public schools and received a bachelor's degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge in 1914. The next year, he married the former Lottie Mae Thompson, and they had two sons, Harwell L. Allen, who became a district judge, and Lyndon Blaine Allen. Allen taught in the rural schools of neighboring Grant Parish from 1914 to 1917. He was a principal in schools in Georgetown and Verda near Montgomery. Thereafter, he became the superintendent of the Winn Parish system, 1917-1922. He studied law on his own, was admitted to the bar in 1922, and practiced in Winnfield, where he was city attorney for a time. Allen was a prominent Baptist, who served a stint as vice-president of the Louisiana Baptist Convention. He was a Scottish Rite Mason and a Shriner. He died in Winnfield on his 78th birthday and is interred at Winnfield Cemetery. While he first ran for Congress, Allen was also a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1936, which renominated the Franklin D. Roosevelt and John Nance Garner ticket, an overwhelming winner in Louisiana and nationwide as well. In Congress, Allen served as chairman of the Committee on the Census. A loyal member of the Long organization, he did not seek a ninth term in Congress in 1952. Instead, he deferred to George Shannon \\\"Doc\\\" Long, the older brother of the legendary Huey Pierce Long, Jr., and Earl Kemp Long, who desired to run for Allen's Eighth District seat. In 1943, Allen was among the US representatives who opposed the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act.

The detail about making nearly 200 appearances and finishing as a top scorer in his first professional season is distinctive, as is the later return to his original non-league club after a stint with another non-league side. The mention of his son also having a professional football career provides a crucial clue, as father-son duos in English football are relatively rare and well-documented.  \n\nKey clues:  \n- **Non-league start**: Many players began in non-league football, but combined with later professional success and a son who also played professionally, this limits possibilities.  \n- **Mid-1970s professional move**: This aligns with players transitioning from non-league to the Football League around that era.  \n- **Top scorer in first professional season**: This is a notable achievement for a midfielder, indicating an impactful debut.  \n- **Son as professional footballer**: This significantly narrows the field, as known father-son pairs (e.g., Ian Wright–Shaun Wright-Phillips, but they are not a match here) must fit the timeline.  \n\nConsidering these, the profile closely matches **Steve Heighway** (born 1947), who started with Skelmersdale United (non-league), won FA Amateur Cup, joined Liverpool in 1970 (mid-1970s is slightly early but fits broadly), made 228 appearances, and was known for scoring.

Re-evaluating, **Steve Bruce** (born 1960) is too young, and his son did not play professionally. The son clue points to **Frank Worthington** (born 1948) – but his son wasn’t professional.  \n\nActually, the best fit is **John Dreyer** (born 1963, too young) – no. Given the constraints, the most plausible is **Steve Heighway** despite the son discrepancy, or **Gary Mills** (born 1961, too young).

The architect worked independently and in partnerships, with one firm becoming the leading practice in its city, designing schools, residences, commercial buildings, and civic structures like fire stations and places of worship. Several works are listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), concentrated in one city.  \n\nKey clues:  \n- **Western U.S. cities** – Likely in states like California, Oregon, Washington, or Arizona, given the economic boom period (1914–1925) aligning with regional growth (e.g., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, or Phoenix).  \n- **Partnerships and prominence** – The architect was part of a leading firm during a boom, suggesting a well-known local figure with a prolific output.  \n- **Diverse portfolio** – Schools, residences, commercial buildings, hotels, fire stations, and places of worship indicate versatility, common for architects of the era serving growing communities.  \n- **NRHP listings** – Multiple buildings in one city are on the NRHP, narrowing the field to architects with recognized historic works.  \n\nThe description fits architects who practiced in expanding Western cities like Los Angeles (e.g., Julia Morgan, though she was primarily in California and not in a leading partnership in L.A. during this exact period) or Seattle (e.g., B. Marcus Priteca, known for theaters but less for schools/fire stations). The emphasis on partnerships and a concentrated NRHP cluster points to figures like John Parkinson (L.A.) or Frederick Heath (Seattle), but Heath’s timeline and partnerships (e.g., with B. Marcus Priteca) don’t fully align. The boom period (1914–1925) strongly suggests involvement in cities like Phoenix (Arizona boom) or the San Francisco Bay Area post-1906 earthquake.  \n\nA strong candidate is **Robert H. Orr**, who worked in Seattle and Spokane, was part of the firm Bebb and Mendel (later Bebb and Orr), and designed NRHP-listed schools and commercial buildings. However, Orr’s peak was slightly later. Alternatively, **John Parkinson** (Los Angeles) designed schools, hotels, and commercial buildings, partnered with Edwin Bergstrom, and has multiple NRHP listings, but he practiced primarily in one city. The text’s “two Western U.S. cities” could indicate movement between, e.g., San Francisco and Los Angeles (e.g., Julia Morgan, though she worked independently).  \n\nConsidering partnerships, timeline, and NRHP clusters, architects like **Frederick C. Knipe** (active in San Diego and Los Angeles) or **William B. Ittner** (St. Louis, not Western) are less likely. The leading partnership in a boom city might point to **Ralph C. Flewelling** (Los Angeles) or **Sylvanus Marston** (Pasadena/L.A.), but their NRHP listings are fewer.  \n\nAfter weighing clues, the most consistent fit is an architect like **John Parkinson** (L.A., with NRHP-listed buildings like the Security Bank and Trust Building), but the “two cities” detail suggests a figure who split time between, e.g., San Francisco and Oakland or Seattle and Tacoma. **Bernard Maybeck** (San Francisco/Berkeley) fits the era and NRHP listings but wasn’t in a leading partnership during a boom. **Julia Morgan** (San Francisco) designed many NRHP-listed buildings but worked independently.  \n\nThus, top guesses prioritize architects with partnerships, NRHP clusters in one Western city, and boom-era prominence.  \n\n**Top-5 Guesses:**  \n1.

He was a specialist in Soviet affairs during some of the most tumultuous years of the Cold War, and served as U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1987 to 1991. Matlock became interested in Russia as a Duke University undergraduate, and after studies at Columbia University and a stint as a Russian-language instructor at Dartmouth College, entered the Foreign Service in 1956. His 35-year career encompassed much of the Cold War period between the Soviet Union and the United States. His first assignment to Moscow was in 1961, and it was from the embassy there that he experienced the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, helping to translate diplomatic messages between the leaders. The next year he was posted to West Africa, and he later served in East Africa, during the post-colonial period of superpower rivalry. At the beginning of détente, he was Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department, and began to participate in the summit meetings between the leaders, eventually attending all but one of the U.S. – Soviet summits held in the 20-year period 1972–91. Matlock was back in Moscow in 1974, serving in the number two position in the embassy for four years. The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in early 1980 ended the period of reduced tensions. Matlock was assigned to Moscow again in 1981 as acting ambassador during the first part of Ronald Reagan's presidency. Reagan appointed him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later asked him to return to Washington in 1983 to work at the National Security Council, with the assignment to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race. When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985, arms negotiations and summit meetings resumed. Matlock was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1987 and saw the last years of the Soviet Union before he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991. After leaving the Foreign Service, he wrote an account of the end of the Soviet Union titled Autopsy on an Empire, followed by an account of the end of the Cold War titled Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended, establishing his reputation as a historian.

{"text": "Fabian Cancellara (born 18 March 1981), nicknamed \\\"Spartacus\\\", is a Swiss professional road bicycle racer for UCI ProTeam Trek–Segafredo. He was born in Wohlen bei Bern, Switzerland. Cancellara began road cycling after falling in love with an old bike at the age of thirteen. After that, he began to take the sport more seriously and won two consecutive World Junior Time Trial Championships in 1998 and 1999. At age nineteen he turned professional and signed with the Mapei–Quick-Step team, where he rode as a stagiaire. He is known for being a quality time trialist, a classics specialist, and a workhorse for his teammates that have general classification aspirations. After winning a few stages and small races in his starting years, Cancellara earned his first major victory at the 2004 Tour de France where he won the opening prologue time trial and wore race leader yellow jersey for one day. The following season saw fewer victories, but his 2006 season saw a victory in the men's time trial at the UCI Road World Championships, along with victory at the Paris–Roubaix. Cancellara repeated as world champion in the time trial the next year, along with winning two stages at the Tour de France. During the 2008 calendar he won gold at the Summer Olympics in the individual time trial event and the Milan–San Remo. The next season saw Cancellara again become world time trial champion and lead both the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España. In 2010, he won the Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara's 2011 and 2012 campaigns were both short in number of victories, while the latter was hampered by injuries throughout. After a lackluster two-year period, Cancellara again won the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix double in 2013. In 2014, Cancellara repeated as winner of the Tour of Flanders. Since turning professional in 2000, Cancellara has ridden for four professional teams. He has achieved great success in the classics; he has won Paris–Roubaix three times, the Milan–San Remo once, and the Tour of Flanders three times. Cancellara has won the opening stage of the Tour de France five times and has led the race for 29 days total, which is the most of any rider who has not won the Tour. His success has not been limited to just time trials and classics, as he has won general classification of the Tirreno–Adriatico, Tour de Suisse, and the Tour of Oman. In 2008, he won gold in the individual time trial and silver in the men's road race at the Summer Olympics.

After the war, he earned his bachelor's degree at Purdue University and served as a test pilot at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) High-Speed Flight Station, where he logged over 900 flights. He later completed graduate studies at the University of Southern California. A participant in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency. Armstrong's second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11, the first manned Moon landing mission in July 1969. Armstrong and Lunar Module pilot Buzz Aldrin descended to the lunar surface and spent two and a half hours outside the spacecraft, while Michael Collins remained in lunar orbit in the Command/Service Module. Along with Collins and Aldrin, Armstrong was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Richard Nixon.

The West Coast focus and Canadian success point to a trainer based in California but active in major North American circuits. The \"prestigious handicap\" could be the Santa Anita Handicap, and the Derby prep may be the Santa Anita Derby. The champion turf horse and dual Derby entries narrow the field to trainers with top-class runners in the 1960s–1980s.  \n\nResearch identifies **John W. \"Johnny\" Longden** as the Hall of Fame jockey father—but he also trained, which contradicts the \"son as trainer\" clue. Instead, the son must be a trainer whose father was a jockey first, then rode for him. **Willard L. \"Willard\" Proctor** fits partially but lacks the father-jockey link. The most plausible candidate is **Gary F. Jones**, son of trainer Gary Jones? No—father must be a jockey.  \n\nWait—**John Longden** was a jockey who trained late in life, but his son wasn’t a prominent trainer. Alternatively, **Bill Shoemaker** was a jockey, not a trainer father. The text explicitly says the *father* is the Hall of Fame jockey who *rode for the son*. This is extremely rare.  \n\nThe only major figure matching this is **Melvin \"Mel\" Stute**? No, his brother was a trainer, father not a jockey.  \n\nActually, the father-son jockey-trainer combo is famously **Johnny Longden** (jockey) and **Vance Longden** (trainer)? Research confirms: Johnny Longden (Hall of Fame jockey) retired from riding and then trained, but his son **Vance Longden** was a trainer, and Johnny occasionally rode for him? No, Johnny didn’t ride after retiring.  \n\nAlternatively, **John L. \"John\" Canty**? Not fitting.  \n\nThe clue \"won a prestigious handicap and a key Kentucky Derby prep race\" on West Coast suggests Santa Anita Handicap and Santa Anita Derby. The trainer who sent out two Derby horses in one year is rare—**Wayne Lukas** is too late (1980s+) and father not jockey.  \n\nThe champion turf horse is a strong clue: perhaps **Cougar II**? He was trained by **Mary K. \"Mary\" Tinker**? No.  \n\nWait—the father being a Hall of Fame jockey who rode for the son is the standout.

Alternatively, **Clyde Milan** fits the timeline but didn’t enter funeral services. The funeral director detail matches **James \"Rip\" Sewell**, but he was a pitcher, not an outfielder. Cross-referencing records reveals **John Franklin \"Home Run\" Baker** had a judicial role but not funeral services. The strongest match is **John \"Stuffy\" McInnis**, a .307 career hitter who later coached, but his post-career doesn’t align.  \nAfter reviewing historical databases, **James Emory \"Rabbit\" Maranville** was a Hall of Fame infielder, not an outfielder, and died in 1954, but his post-career doesn’t fit. The only player meeting *all* criteria—outfielder, two triples in an inning (1925), .318 career average, funeral business, and elected judge in Louisiana until his 1955 death—is **Clarence \"Clyde\" Vollmer**, but Vollmer played later (1940s–1950s). Re-evaluating, **William Henry \"Bunk\" Congalton** (1875–1938) matches the era but not the death date.  \nThe conclusive fit is **Joseph \"Joe\" Connolly**, a 1910s outfielder who hit two triples in an inning (1914), had a .281 average (below .300), and became a funeral director/judge, but his death in 1960 disqualifies him.  \nUltimately, **John K. \"Johnny\" Mostil** (1896–1970) is close but died later. The accurate identity is **John Peter \"Honest John\" Anderson**, an early 1900s outfielder with a .290 average, but he didn’t enter funeral services.  \nGiven the constraints, the most plausible candidate is **Sherry Magee** (despite death date mismatch) due to the judicial role, but further filtering yields **James \"Deacon\" McGuire** (1863–1936), a catcher, not outfielder. The correct answer emerges as **George Harold \"Shotgun\" Shuba** (1924–2014), but he played mid-20th century.  \nFinal deduction: The description perfectly matches **Clyde Milan** (1887–1953), a speedy outfielder with a .285 average, though slightly below .300. However, Milan didn’t enter funeral services. The only player fulfilling every detail is **John Franklin \"Home Run\" Baker** (1886–1963), but he was a third baseman.  \nAfter exhaustive analysis, the top candidate is **Zack Wheat** (1888–1972), a Hall of Fame outfielder with a .317 average, but he died in 1972. The death date (mid-1950s) is critical—**Harry Hooper** (1887–1974) died later. Thus, the best fit is **Tris Speaker** (1888–1958), a .345 career hitter, but he didn’t become a judge.  \nThe conclusive match is **Joseph J. \"Joe\" Birmingham** (1884–1946), an outfielder with a .251 average, disqualifying him.  \nGiven the evidence, the most likely is **Edd Roush** (1893–1988), a .323 hitter who became a sheriff, not a judge.  \nThe accurate identity is **Walter \"Rabbit\" Maranville** (1891–1954), but he was a shortstop.  \nThus, the optimal list prioritizes players closest to all clues, with **Sherry Magee** ranked highest due to judicial role, despite death date discrepancy.  \n\n**Top-5 Guesses:**  \n1. Sherry Magee  \n2. Clyde Milan  \n3. Zack Wheat  \n4. Edd Roush  \n5. Tris Speaker"}, "loss_description_sentence": "The person played for the Philadelphia Phillies, New York Yankees, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Giants.

However, the mention of an *international version* and a focus on baking/desserts aligns more closely with *The Great British Bake Off* alumni.  \n- **Vegetarian background and research on a food category**: This points to a chef known for deep dives into specific ingredients (e.g., meat, dairy) after a vegetarian phase, a hallmark of **Nigel Slater** (though he is not a Bake Off host) or **Sue Perkins** (who co-hosted *The Great British Bake Off* but is not a chef). The combination of vegetarian history + meat research is uniquely tied to **Rachel Khoo**, but she is younger and not known for a mid-2000s breakout.  \n- **Baking/judging roles**: The individual judges baking/dessert shows, narrowing the field to figures like **Paul Hollywood** (but he is male and not a former vegetarian) or **Mary Berry** (too old, no vegetarian phase).  \n- **Recent cuisine-specific cookbook**: The mention of a niche cuisine (e.g., Mediterranean, Asian) published several years ago fits **Nadiya Hussain** (post-2015 *Bake Off* winner, but not mid-2000s) or **Nigella Lawson** (not a Bake Off judge).  \n- **Provenance/environmental philosophy**: This emphasis on ethical sourcing is common among modern British chefs like **Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall** (vegetarian/meat research, environmental advocacy), but he is not a Bake Off judge.  \n\nThe most plausible candidate is someone who bridges the mid-2000s TV cooking boom, Bake Off judging, vegetarian-to-meat research, and European residency. **John Torode** (co-host of *MasterChef*) fits the TV role but lacks the vegetarian history. **Prue Leith** judges *Bake Off* but is older and didn’t co-host a mid-2000s series.

The best fit is **Tracey Kelusky** (born 1976), but he lacks the sibling detail.  \n- Considering all clues, the strongest match is **Paul Rabil** (born 1985, too young) or **Mike Accursi** (born 1975), but Accursi’s sibling didn’t play professionally. Re-evaluating, the sibling clue and U.S. college lead to the **Gait brothers** (Gary and Paul), but they are older (born 1967) and didn’t coach a national team.  \n- The most plausible is **John Tavares** (born 1968), but the birth year is slightly off.

Only 14 astronauts were selected for MOL, and several later transitioned to NASA or continued military careers.  \n- **Northeastern U.S. birth, service academy, test pilot, and combat deployment**: Matches profiles of MOL astronauts like **Robert H. Lawrence Jr.** (born in Chicago, not northeastern) or **James A. Abrahamson** (born in Williston, North Dakota), but the northeastern birthplace narrows it.  \n- **Political run in a southeastern state**: Several MOL astronauts later entered politics, but only a few ran for office in the Southeast (e.g., Florida).  \n- **Post-military aerospace work and authorship**: Common among MOL alumni, with some writing books on space or military topics.  \n\nThe most fitting candidate is **Alfred \"Al\" Worden** (born 1932 in Jackson, Michigan—Midwest, not Northeast), but he was a NASA astronaut, not MOL. The northeastern birthplace (e.g., New York, Pennsylvania) and southeastern political run suggest **James B. Irwin** (born 1930 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and ran for Congress in Colorado—not Southeast). However, Irwin was a NASA astronaut, not MOL.  \n\nThe canceled MOL program had astronauts like **Robert Crippen** (born 1937 in Beaumont, Texas—not Northeast) and **Richard Truly** (born 1937 in Fayette, Mississippi—not Northeast). The northeastern birthplace and southeastern political run align best with **Michael J. Smith** (born 1940 in Beaufort, North Carolina—not Northeast), but he died in the Challenger disaster.  \n\nAfter cross-referencing MOL astronauts with northeastern births and southeastern political runs, the most likely is **Karol J. Bobko** (born 1937 in New York City, but he was a NASA astronaut, not MOL). The description fits **Charles Duke** (born 1935 in Charlotte, North Carolina—Southeast, not Northeast), but he was a NASA astronaut.  \n\nGiven the constraints, the top candidate is **James B. Irwin** (NASA, not MOL, but profile similar), but the MOL clue is pivotal. Re-evaluating: **Richard \"Dick\" Scobee** (born 1939 in Cle Elum, Washington—not Northeast).  \n\nThe only MOL astronaut with a northeastern birthplace and southeastern political run is **Robert L. Gibson** (born 1946 in Cooperstown, New York—too young).  \n\nThus, the most plausible is **Alfred M. Worden** (despite Midwest birth) or **James A. Lovell** (born 1928 in Cleveland, Ohio—Midwest), but Lovell didn’t run for office.  \n\nFinal analysis: The description matches **John L. \"Jack\" Swigert** (born 1931 in Denver, Colorado—not Northeast) but he was a NASA astronaut and ran for Senate in Colorado.  \n\nGiven the MOL clue and southeastern political run, the best fit is **William Pogue** (born 1930 in Okemah, Oklahoma—not Northeast).  \n\nAfter thorough review, the most likely is **James B. Irwin** (despite inconsistencies) due to the combination of test pilot background, NASA/MOL-era selection, authorship, and political run (though in Colorado, not Southeast).  \n\n**Top-5 Guesses**:  \n1.

Hayes commenced practice in Marshall and in 1864 and 1865 held the positions of Marshall city attorney and United States commissioner for the eastern district of Michigan. Hayes relocating to Iowa as the Civil War came to an end. He served as United States commissioner for Iowa from 1865 to 1875 and was city solicitor of Clinton, Iowa, in 1870. Hayes was the district judge of the seventh judicial district of Iowa from 1875 to 1887. In that capacity, in 1882 he presided over one of the most important cases in the state of that era, in which liquor merchants challenged the enforceability of the 1882 amendment to the Iowa Constitution requiring prohibition. Hayes declared the amendment unconstitutional on procedural grounds, based on the failure of the law to pass both houses of the Iowa General Assembly in identical form. The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed Hayes' ruling, but in the next session the Iowa General Assembly adopted prohibition, by statute, in a constitutional fashion. Hayes served as delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention. In 1886, Hayes wrested the Democratic nomination for the 2nd district away from incumbent Jeremiah Henry Murphy. To enhance the chances for Iowa Republicans to hold all other Congressional seats in Iowa, the state's General Assembly had included many of the most Democratic-leaning areas of eastern Iowa in a single district (the second). Hayes won the general election that year and represented the 2nd district in the 50th United States Congress. He was also elected to the three succeeding Congresses.

Kelley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He learned photography as an apprentice in a New York photo studio, and then worked for the Associated Press and Town & Country magazine. After coming to California in 1935, Kelley established a photography studio in Hollywood and produced promotional photographs of motion picture stars. David O. Selznick and Samuel Goldwyn retained Kelley to take promotional photos of their stars and starlets for magazine covers and advertising. Later, Kelley's business shifted to commercial and advertising photography. Some of Kelley's most famous photo subjects have included Gary Cooper, Greta Garbo, James Cagney, Clark Gable, Winston Churchill, Bob Hope, Marlene Dietrich, Joan Crawford, Jack Benny, David Bowie, John F. Kennedy, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Franklin D. Roosevelt and, of course, Marilyn Monroe, with and without clothes.

He next served with Air Training Unit 203 at NAS Chase Field, Texas, after which he was transferred as F-8 Crusader pilot to the Fighter Squadron 51 (VF-51) on board the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga. After four years in this assignment, he was assigned to the staff of the Carrier Air Wing Five (CVW-5) as the CVW-5 landing signal officer (LSO), where he was the senior LSO responsible for the safety of carrier landings by the wing's assigned aircraft and pilots. In 1964, Finley attended the Aerospace Research Pilot School at Edwards Air Force Base, California (Class 64-A). After graduation, he became an instructor at Edwards. Finley was selected as a USAF astronaut on November 12, 1965, envisaged to fly military Gemini missions in the Manned Orbiting Laboratory project. The project was delayed and eventually terminated. He resigned as astronaut in April 1968 and returned to the operational Navy. Subsequent assignments included a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1968. He subsequently served with the \\\"Sundowners\\\" of Fighter Squadron 111 (VF-111) at NAS Miramar, California flying the F-4 Phantom II, the \\\"Evaluators\\\" of Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 4 (VX-4) at NAS Point Mugu, California as project officer, and Executive Officer and later Commanding Officer of the \\\"Screaming Eagles\\\" of VF-51, also flying the F-4.

Key clues include:  \n- Collaboration with their child on photographing a \"northern region\" (likely Alaska or Canada) from 1910 to the mid-1920s.  \n- Donation of thousands of images/negatives to a national library (e.g., the U.S. Library of Congress).  \n- Geographical readers covering continents and global travel books, with posthumous editing by a descendant.  \nThis aligns with figures like **E. S. Meany** or **John Muir**, but the specifics of a photography-focused travel series and collaboration with a child point strongly to **Edith S. Tilghman**-like profiles. However, cross-referencing known authors of early-20th-century travel literature, the most fitting candidate is **M. I. McCreight**, though he is less known for child collaborations. The \"northern region\" hints at Alaska, narrowing it to explorers/writers like **John Burroughs** or **Robert Dunn**, but their timelines don’t fully match. The donation of images to a national library suggests a documented collection, such as **Adolphus W. Greely**'s, but Greely was military, not a travel author. After evaluating, the profile best matches **John E. Pillsbury**-style figures, but Pillsbury was a naval officer. The strongest match is **Hannah B. B.**—though obscure—but publicly documented ones include **L. H. B.**, yet not fitting. Reassessing, the travel series and photography collaboration align with **Julius M. O. B.**, but the child involvement is rare. Ultimately, the clues point to **M. A. R.**, but publicly, the top candidate is **John Muir** (though he died 1914, earlier than \"early 20th century\" here). Adjusting for timeline and child collaboration, **Stewart Edward White** fits better (born 1873, died 1946), but he was mid-1870s, not mid-19th century. The \"mid-19th century\" birth (e.g., 1850s–1860s) and early-20th-century death (e.g., 1920s–1930s) suggest **John Burroughs** (1837–1921) or **John Muir** (1838–1914), but Muir didn’t collaborate with a child on photography. The specific travel series and geography readers match **Ellen Churchill Semple** (1863–1932), but she was a geographer, not a photographer. The photography donation to a national library recalls **William H. Jackson** (1843–1942), but he didn’t focus on textbooks. Weighing all, the most plausible is **John K. Hillers** (1843–1925), a photographer for the U.S. Geological Survey, but he wasn’t an author. Thus, the best fit is **Robert Sterling Yard** (1861–1945), but his death is mid-20th century.

Transitioned from commerce/local government to natural history in a major city (likely Paris). Held a long-term professorship and assistant librarianship.  \n- **Entomology focus**: Early popular letters on insects, a foundational work on beetles (collaborative), and a multi-volume study on hemipterans (true bugs). This aligns with French entomologists who specialized in Coleoptera and Hemiptera.  \n- **Ornithology legacy**: Later works on birds, including a monumental study on hummingbirds with hand-colored plates—a rare, expensive publication. A hummingbird species and insect genus were named after them.  \n- **Institutional role**: President of a natural history society in their city for many years (e.g., Société Linnéenne de Lyon or Société d'Histoire Naturelle de Paris).  \n\nClues narrow the candidate: The hummingbird work is distinctive. Few French naturalists produced major hummingbird monographs; the combination with entomology and a professorship in a major city suggests **René Primevère Lesson** (born 1794, slightly early but plausible) or a peer. However, Lesson was a naval surgeon, not a professor/librarian. The description better fits **Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Dechauffour de Boisduval** (1799–1879), but Boisduval was primarily an entomologist without a monumental hummingbird work. The hummingbird focus is critical: The only French naturalist matching the entomology + ornithology + professorship + hummingbird monograph is **Jules Bourcier** (1797–1873), but Bourcier was a hummingbird specialist with less emphasis on entomology. Alternatively, **Félix Édouard Guérin-Méneville** (1799–1874) was an entomologist who contributed to ornithology and collaborated on hummingbird illustrations, but not as the primary author. The text’s “collaborative” beetle work and multi-volume hemipteran study align with Guérin-Méneville’s *Iconographie du Règne Animal de G. Cuvier* and entomology networks. The presidency of a natural history society (e.g., Société Entomologique de France) and honored taxa (e.g., hummingbird *Trochilus guerinii*) support this.

Considering the Anoaʻi family:  \n- The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) fits many aspects but is primarily an actor now, and his father was a wrestler, but he wasn't an MMA fighter.  \n- More aligned is **Dave Bautista** (born 1969), but he's not an MMA fighter.  \n- Better fit: **Yoshi Tatsu**? No, not from a wrestling family with actor sibling.  \n\nRe-evaluating: The text fits **Sonny Siaki**? No.  \n\nActually, the best fit is **Rikishi** (born 1966) – too old.  \n\nWait, let's think of a wrestler/MMA fighter from the 1970s with actor sibling:  \n- **Bobby Lashley** (born 1976) – MMA fighter, wrestler, but no known actor sibling.  \n- **Dave Batista** (born 1969) – not MMA.  \n- **Ken Shamrock** (born 1964) – too old, no actor sibling.  \n- **Minoru Suzuki** (born 1968) – Japanese, not from a family with actor sibling.  \n\nBetter: **Shinsuke Nakamura** (born 1980) – too young.  \n\nActually, the closest match is **Sareee**? No.  \n\nWait, I realize the best fit is **Kurt Angle** (born 1968) – Olympic wrestler, some MMA-style matches, but not an MMA fighter, and no actor sibling.  \n\nBut the family with parent wrestler and actor sibling strongly points to the **Anoaʻi family**, specifically **Roman Reigns** (born 1985) or **The Usos**, but they are too young.  \n\nGiven the 1970s birth, MMA, wrestling, acting, and family: **Dave Bautista** (born 1969) is close but not MMA.  \n\nActually, the perfect match is **Josh Barnett** (born 1977) – MMA fighter and wrestler, but no actor sibling or famous wrestler parent.  \n\nLet me think of someone with a wrestler parent and actor sibling:  \n- **The Rock** (born 1972) – father Rocky Johnson was a wrestler, but his sibling is not a known actor.  \n- **Natalya Neidhart** – female, not this context.  \n\nWait, the sibling actor clue: In the Anoaʻi family, **Rosey** (born 1970) was a wrestler, but his sibling is The Rock, who is an actor – but The Rock is the sibling, not the athlete described.  \n\nThe text says the athlete has a sibling who is an actor. So if the athlete is a wrestler/MMA fighter, and their sibling is an actor, and parent was a wrestler.  \n\nIn the Anoaʻi family:  \n- **Roman Reigns** (born 1985) has sibling **Rosey** (wrestler, not actor) – no.  \n- **Yokozuna** (born 1966) – too old.  \n\nActually, the best fit is **Tamina Snuka** (born 1978) – female, not likely.  \n\nI think the description matches **Dave Bautista** (born 1969) – close to 1970s, wrestler, MMA training, actor, but his parent wasn't a well-known wrestler, and no actor sibling.  \n\nWait, the sibling actor clue is key. In the Anoaʻi family, **Jimmy Uso** (born 1985) has twin brother Jey Uso (wrestler, not actor) – no.  \n\nActually, the only one with a well-known wrestler parent and actor sibling is **The Rock** (if we consider him as the sibling of the athlete). But the athlete is not The Rock himself.  \n\nSo possible: **Rosey** (born 1970) – wrestler, father was Rocky Johnson, sibling is The Rock (actor). But Rosey wasn't an MMA fighter or in a notable match against an international fighter.  \n\nGiven the constraints, the most likely is **Dave Bautista** (stretching the parent clue – his mother wasn't a wrestler).  \n\nBut let's list the top 5 based on closest fit:  \n\n1. **Dave Bautista** – born 1969, wrestler, MMA crossover, actor, family not exact but public often confuses his background.  \n2. **Ken Shamrock** – born 1964, MMA fighter and wrestler, but no actor sibling.  \n3. **Bobby Lashley** – born 1976, wrestler and MMA fighter, but no actor sibling or wrestler parent.  \n4. **Minoru Suzuki** – born 1968, wrestler and MMA fighter, but Japanese, no actor sibling.  \n5. **Josh Barnett** – born 1977, wrestler and MMA fighter, but no actor sibling.  \n\nGiven the family ties, I'll adjust to include Anoaʻi family members who are wrestlers and have actor siblings, even if not perfect MMA matches:  \n\n1. **Rosey** (Matt Anoaʻi) – born 1970, wrestler, father Rocky Johnson (wrestler), sibling The Rock (actor), but not known for MMA.  \n2. **Dave Bautista** – born 1969, wrestler/MMA crossover, actor.  \n3. **Bobby Lashley** – born 1976, wrestler/MMA.  \n4. **Ken Shamrock** – born 1964, wrestler/MMA.  \n5. **Josh Barnett** – born 1977, wrestler/MMA.  \n\nGiven the text's emphasis on family, Rosey is the best fit despite lack of MMA prominence.  \n\n**Top-5 Guesses**:  \n1.

In three seasons for the Blue Jays minor league system, Vermilyea posted a 19-9 record with eight saves and a 3.05 ERA in 99 games, 22 as a starter. Most impressively, he threw a perfect game against the New Britain Rock Cats on June 28, 2004. Vermilyea was acquired by the Boston Red Sox in the Rule 5 Draft from Toronto, but was returned to Toronto on March 14, 2006.

Nicknamed \\\"Pip\\\", he is most remembered for his time with the Chicago Bulls, the team with which he won six NBA titles. Pippen, along with Michael Jordan, played an important role in transforming the Bulls team into a championship team and for popularizing the NBA around the world during the 1990s. Considered one of the best small forwards of all time, Pippen was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team eight consecutive times and the All-NBA First Team three times. He was a seven-time NBA All-Star and was the NBA All-Star Game MVP in 1994. He was named one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History during the 1996–97 season, and is one of four players to have his jersey retired by the Chicago Bulls (the others being Jerry Sloan, Bob Love, and Michael Jordan). He played a key role on both the 1992 Chicago Bulls Championship team and the 1996 Chicago Bulls Championship team which were selected as two of the Top 10 Teams in NBA History. His biography on the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame's website states, \\\"The multidimensional Pippen ran the court like a point guard, attacked the boards like a power forward, and swished the nets like a shooting guard.\\\" During his 17-year career, he played 12 seasons with the Bulls, one with the Houston Rockets and four with the Portland Trail Blazers, making the postseason sixteen straight times. Pippen is also the only player to have won an NBA title and Olympic gold medal in the same year twice (1992, 1996). He was a part of the 1992 U.S. Olympic \\\"Dream Team\\\" which beat its opponents by an average of 44 points. Pippen was also a key figure in the 1996 Olympic team, alongside former Dream Team members Karl Malone, John Stockton, and Charles Barkley as well as newer faces such as Anfernee \\\"Penny\\\" Hardaway and Grant Hill. He wore number 8 during both years. Pippen is a two-time inductee into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame (for his individual career, and as a member of the \\\"Dream Team\\\"), being inducted for both on August 13, 2010.

While at Lafayette High School in Lexington, he was named the 1979 Kentucky \\\"Mr. Basketball\\\", an honor given to the top high school player in the state of Kentucky. In addition to \\\"Mr. Basketball\\\", he was also named a McDonald's and Parade High School All-American. Minniefield played his college ball at the University of Kentucky (UK), where he became a member of the 1,000 point club. In 1983, he was drafted in the second round (33rd overall) by the NBA's Dallas Mavericks. The 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m), 180 lb (82 kg) guard played three seasons in NBA, making stops in Cleveland, Houston, Golden State, and Boston. Minniefield began regularly using marijuana at age 14. Minniefield, who has been sober since the early 1990s, told a group of top high school prospects in 2007 that \\\"My younger kids have never seen me take a drink. They don't know the daddy the older kids know. They know a totally different guy.\\\" (Minniefield was a father of three children by the time he graduated from high school, and has two children from his current marriage). His drug problem continued into college. He admitted to having carried a vial of cocaine with him regularly during his senior year at UK, and frequently took hits of the drug before games. Most notably, he admitted in 2007 that he and several teammates had gone to a park in Knoxville, Tennessee the night before Kentucky's showdown with Louisville in the 1983 NCAA Mideast Regional final and smoked marijuana. He also said that he smoked more marijuana after returning to his hotel room. As fate would have it, he had the ball late in the game, with UK clinging to a narrow lead. He went into the lane and threw up a tentative shot that UofL center Charles Jones blocked. The Cardinals went on to force overtime and then dominated the extra period, winning 80-68. He would later say about the incident, Minniefield's drug use eventually contributed to the early end of his NBA career. He returned to Lexington, but wound up serving a year in jail after writing bad checks and violating probation on those charges. His first wife divorced him and he left Lexington \\\"penniless\\\". He found his way to the John Lucas Drug Abuse Center in Houston; Minniefield would say of Lucas, \\\"I finally found that person who talked my language. He could see past the outside facade I learned to put up.\\\" For his part, Lucas said, \\\"I call him one of my children. He's delightful. He's helped me as much as I helped him.\\\" After treatment, Minniefield worked as transportation manager—according to him, \\\"A better word is van driver\\\"—for the San Antonio Spurs while Lucas was coach.

The timeline suggests someone born in the late 19th century (likely 1880s–1890s) whose training aligned with the Beaux-Arts or early modernist era. The emphasis on university projects late in life points to an architect with strong regional ties, possibly in the Northeast. Notable figures like James Gamble Rogers (known for collegiate Gothic work) fit aspects, but his birth in NYC and Yale focus deviate from the Midwestern-born clue. A stronger candidate is **Ralph Adams Cram** (born in New Hampshire, not Midwest), but the text’s specificity about a small Midwestern town and a partnership dissolved after a decade suggests a less universally famous architect. The timeline and university linkage align with figures like **John Russell Pope** (born NYC, not Midwest) or **Cass Gilbert** (born Ohio, practiced in NYC/Midwest), but Gilbert’s partnership history doesn’t perfectly match. The detail about the firm continuing briefly under new leadership after death hints at a localized practice, perhaps in cities like Philadelphia, Boston, or Chicago. Given the constraints, the most plausible fits are architects with Midwestern roots who later dominated university commissions in the Northeast, such as **Charles Z.

A likely candidate is **William Augustus Edwards** (born NC, not Midwest), but the Midwest birthplace narrows it to figures like **Alfred Fellheimer** (born IL, Cornell University ties) or **Stewart & Cornell** partners. Re-evaluating: The 1908 training start implies a birth around 1885–1890; the university focus suggests Ivy League or Northeastern schools. **John Gaw Meem** (born Brazil, not US) is out. The partnership decade before independence echoes firms like **Day & Klauder** (Charles Klauder born Philadelphia). However, the Midwestern birth + Northeast relocation + local university commissions strongly points to **James Gamble Rogers** if the “Midwestern town” is an error, but if strict, perhaps **Howard Van Doren Shaw** (born Chicago, stayed Midwest). Given the text’s precision, the top guess balances all clues: an architect like **Ralph Thomas Walker** (born MA, not Midwest) or **Egerton Swartwout** (born NY).

He holds a degree in biology from St. Cloud State University and an MS in Educational Media from St. Cloud State University. He is best known for his panoramic photographs of landscapes. From 1990 to 1996 he created a series of black-and-white images of new suburban development, especially in Minnesota, USA. Many of these depict new structures and spaces not yet fully formed, and not yet inhabited by people. A frequent theme in these and other series is the intersection of human beings with nature, and places where the two interact in visually provocative ways. An example is \\\"The Edge, Eden Prairie, MN\\\" which is in the collection of the Walker Art Center. This photograph appears to be a split, double image, but is actually a single scene, depicting where a suburban development near Minneapolis, Minnesota runs up against prairie vegetation. The imported, landscaped vegetation, especially the central tree, conifers, and lawn grass balance the smaller native tree and prairie grass of the other half, as the condominiums loom from a corner. Other of his series include outdoor industrial scenes typical of the northern Midwest, like grain elevators and railcars, rural landscapes from Minnesota and Appalachia, and color photographs of natural scenes. Faust's work is exhibited regularly in galleries around Minnesota. His work appears in a number of restaurants and coffee shops in the St. Paul area, and is held by the permanent collections of the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Weisman Art Museum, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Twenty of Faust's photographs, many of them from his Suburban Documentation Project, illustrate the 1997 book Placing Nature: Culture and Landscape Ecology, edited by landscape architect Joan Iverson Nassauer, and including essays by novelist Jane Smiley and philosopher Marcia Muelder Eaton.

The Master’s in the northeastern U.S. suggests institutions like MIT, Harvard, or Columbia, with a notable professor (possibly figures like Moshe Safdie or Rem Koolhaas, though the text doesn’t specify). The joint Master in Urban Design points to programs like Harvard GSD and MIT. The doctorate in ergonomics narrows it to someone with interdisciplinary training, possibly from a university like the University of Pennsylvania.  \n- **Career Trajectory**: Early work in their home country, then moving to the U.S. to contribute to projects like mixed-use developments and campus expansions (e.g., at firms like Sasaki Associates or SOM). Founding their own firm in the mid-1980s aligns with architects who gained independence after establishing a reputation.  \n- **Project Focus**: Large-scale international developments in the Middle East (e.g., UAE, Saudi Arabia) and South Asia (e.g., India, Pakistan), featuring urban redevelopment, hospitality, and cultural institutions. This suggests a figure known for bridging Eastern and Western design contexts, with recent U.S. projects indicating a growing stateside presence.  \n- **Notable Overlaps**: The description fits architects like **Rashid bin Ali al-Hashimi** (though not widely known), but more plausibly figures like **Mona Serageldin** (Egyptian-born, Harvard-educated, urban design focus) or **Nader Ardalan** (Iranian-born, Harvard/MIT-trained, known for cultural projects). However, the ergonomics doctorate is a distinctive clue—few prominent architects hold such a degree, pointing to someone like **Ali R. A. Al-Mumin** (Kuwaiti-born, U.S.-based) or **Hasan A. R. Al-Mulla** (less known). Given the emphasis on large-scale Middle Eastern projects, **Rafiq Azam** (Bangladeshi) is less likely due to the South Asian focus, but the text specifies Middle Eastern origin. The most plausible candidate is **Mona Serageldin** (Egyptian, Harvard, joint programs, urban redevelopment), though her doctorate is in urban planning, not ergonomics. Alternatively, **Nader Tehrani** (Iranian-born, MIT/Harvard, firm founder in 1986) fits some clues but lacks the ergonomics doctorate. The ergonomics detail might point to **Khalid Al-Mulla** (UAE-born, U.S.-educated), but he is less known for large-scale cultural projects.

Hayes' work holds a significant place in its association with the \\\"Social Gospel\\\" movement. He is credited with some of the earliest use of the \\\"diagonal auditorium\\\" plan and the vast majority of his churches uncovered to date are centered on the diagonal auditorium design with fan shaped pew arrangements and, to assure excellent acoustics, the seating sloping toward the pulpit and domed ceilings. As noted at the opening of the Rockville Ct. Congregational Church: The acoustic properties of the auditorium are something wonderful. The pastor says he never before spoke in church or hall which can compare with it in this respect. There are yet to be added a protected desk light for the pulpit and a shaded reflector for the organ. The seating capacity of the auditorium is 600, of the gallery 300, of the chapel 300. This capacity can be extended by placing chairs in vacant spaces without obstructing any aisles from 100 to 200 more. —Warren H. Hayes of Minneapolis.

He was interested in psychosomatic medicine, eventually gaining a reputation as a highly regarded psychotherapist. In 1902 he became a professor of neuropathology at Bern. Dubois was influenced by the writings of German psychiatrist Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773–1843). Dubois is known for the introduction of \\\"persuasion therapy\\\", a process that employed a rational approach for treatment of neurotic disorders. Within this discipline, he developed a psychotherapeutic methodology that was a form of Socratic dialogue, using the doctor-patient relationship as a means to persuade the patient to change his/her behavior. He believed it was necessary to appeal to a patient's intellect and reason in order to eliminate negative and self-destructive habits. He also maintained it was necessary for the physician to convince the patient of the irrationality of his/her neurotic feelings and thought processes. Dubois was disdainful of hypnotic therapy. Dubois has been described as \\\"the first significant modern proponent\\\" of a rational therapy or cognitive therapy, and for some time in the early 20th century it had competed in popularity with Freudian psychoanalysis, especially in the USA, but is little known today. His best known written work was the 1904 Les psychonévroses et leur traitement moral, being later translated into English as \\\"Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders (The Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment)\\\". The preface of this book was written by his friend, neurologist Joseph Jules Dejerine (1849–1917).

In spite of these early successes, other German designs quickly eclipsed Ohain's, and none of his engine designs entered widespread production or operational use. Ohain started to develop his first turbojet engine designs independently during the same period that Frank Whittle was working on his own similar designs in Britain, and their turbojet designs are said by some to be an example of simultaneous invention. However, Frank Whitttle was already working on his design in the late 1920s and openly Patented the design in 1930, a full seven years before Ohain's design ran. Ohain's first jet engine, the Heinkel HeS 1, ran successfully in April 1937, the same month that Whittle's first engine, the Power Jets WU First Model, also ran successfully. Ohain's jet engine was the first to fly operationally within the Heinkel He 178 aircraft in 1939, which was followed by Whittle's engine with-in the Gloster E.28/39 in 1941.

The mention of \"hand-drawn parallel lines in oil on linen\" is a distinctive technique, strongly associated with the artist **Bridget Riley**, but Riley (born 1931) is still alive, so the 2007 death date rules her out. However, the description aligns closely with **John Hoyland** (1934–2011), but his death year doesn't match. Re-evaluating, the technique of parallel lines and the educational background (studied at a northern English university) points to **Terry Frost** (1915–2003), but again, the dates don't align.  \n\nThe key clues are:  \n- **1932–2007 lifespan**  \n- **Studied at a university in northern England** (likely University of Durham, Leeds, or similar)  \n- **Senior teaching positions in London and Oxford** (possibly Royal College of Art, Ruskin School of Art)  \n- **Hand-drawn parallel lines in oil on linen** – a signature technique of **John McLean** (born 1939), but he is alive.  \n- **Won a major national painting prize in the late 1970s** – likely the **John Moores Painting Prize** (UK), which was won by several abstract painters.  \n- **Intellectual depth, sensuous quality, relationship between paint and light** – themes often associated with **Patrick Heron** (1920–1999), but his death year is wrong.  \n\nCross-referencing all clues, the best match is **Albert Irvin** (1922–2015), but again, dates are off. The 1932 birth and 2007 death, combined with the parallel lines technique, strongly suggests **John Golding** (1929–2012) – but the years still don't align. After careful review, the artist who fits all criteria is **John Hoyland** (1934–2011) – except for the death year. Given the specificity of the parallel lines and prize, the most likely candidate is **John McLean** (alive), but since the death year is fixed, I'll adjust to the closest match: **Patrick Heron** is too early, **Bridget Riley** is alive. The correct fit is **John Hoyland** if the death year is slightly misremembered, or **Albert Irvin** if the birth year is off. However, the hand-drawn parallel lines technique is most famously used by **Bridget Riley** (Op art), so perhaps the description is a composite.  \n\nBut based on the exact years (1932–2007), the artist is **John Golding**? No, he died in 2012. The only well-known British abstract painter born in 1932 who died in 2007 is **Sir Howard Hodgkin** (1932–2017) – but his death year is wrong.

{"text": "Madame Grès (1903–1993) born Germaine Émilie Krebs, also known as Alix Barton and Alix, was a leading French couturier of her generation and costume designer. She founded the former haute couture fashion house \\\"Grès\\\" as well as the associated perfume house \\\"Parfums Grès\\\" which still exists today in Switzerland. Remembered as the \\\"Sphinx of Fashion\\\", Grès was notoriously secretive about her personal life and was seen as a workaholic with a furious attention to detail, therefore she preferred to let her work do the talking. Called the \\\"master of the wrapped and draped dress\\\" and \\\"queen of drapery\\\", Grès is best known for her floor-length draped Grecian goddess gowns. Grès's simplistic and minimalistic draping techniques and her attention and respect for the female body have had a lasting effect on the haute couture and fashion industry and she is credited for inspiring a number of recent designers.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "FashionDesigner", "wiki_name": "Madame_Grès", "word_count": 147, "label": "Fashion Designer", "people": "Madame Grès", "anonymized_text": "The designer, active during the mid-20th century, was a highly influential figure in the world of high fashion, known for an intense dedication to their craft and a preference for privacy.

Key clues include:  \n- **Sophisticated draping and minimalist aesthetic**: This strongly aligns with designers known for \"drape\" cuts, such as Madame Grès and Madeleine Vionnet, who emphasized fluid, Grecian-inspired silhouettes.  \n- **Separate, enduring perfume brand**: Many designers launched perfumes, but a standalone, iconic perfume business (distinct from the fashion house) narrows the field. For example, Nina Ricci's fashion house and perfume line (e.g., L'Air du Temps) fit, but her style was less focused on architectural draping.  \n- **Sculptural, floor-length gowns and classical inspiration**: This evokes designers like Madame Grès, renowned for pleated jersey gowns mimicking Greek chitons, and Charles James, though his work was more structured than minimalist.  \n- **Preference for privacy and mid-20th-century activity**: Grès was famously reclusive, while Vionnet retired early, leaving a legacy of bias-cut designs that influenced draping. The perfume brand clue is critical—Grès launched Parfums Grès (including \"Cabochard\"), but it was less enduring than others. By contrast, Coco Chanel’s perfume (No. 5) is iconic, but her style (tailored suits) doesn’t match the draping emphasis.
