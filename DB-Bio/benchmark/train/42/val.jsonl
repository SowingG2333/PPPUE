{"text": "Thomas C. Gillmer (1911–2009) was a naval architect and the author of books about modern and historical naval architecture. He was born in Warren, Ohio on July 17, 1911. At his family's summer cottage near Lake Erie in Ohio, he learned to sail a 14-foot sloop by himself. He graduated from Warren High School, then attended the U.S. Naval Academy. After graduating from the U.S. Naval Academy in 1935, he served aboard the light cruisers USS Raleigh (CL-7) and USS Savannah (CL-42) in the Pacific and Mediterranean. In 1941, he joined the Marine Engineering Department at the Naval Academy. During World War II, he served as an instructor of Ship Construction and Damage Control at the U.S. Naval Academy. He resigned his commission with the Navy in 1946 to join the Academy's faculty as a professor and became chairman of the First Class Committee of the Marine Engineering department. (Note: The Marine Engineering Department became the Division of Engineering and Weapons in 1970 which contained the Naval Systems Engineering Department. Naval Systems later became the current Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering Department.) During the 1950s, Professor Gillmer established the Ship Hydromechanics Laboratory in Isherwood Hall which consisted of an 85' × 6' × 4' towing tank, an 18' × 22' × 4' intact and damaged stability demonstration tank and a small circulating water channel. After retiring from the Naval Academy in 1967, Gillmer continued living in Annapolis, where he pursued a career as the architect of sailing vessels and an author on the subject. In 1969, he established the engineering firm Thomas Gillmer, Naval Architect, Inc. in Annapolis. His designs included modern yachts and replicas of historic sailing ships. He worked with artist Melbourne Smith on the design of the Pride of Baltimore in 1976, the Pride of Baltimore II in 1986, and the Kalmar Nyckel in 1997. The Navy hired Gillmer to evaluate the condition of the USS Constitution prior to the vessel's restoration in 1997. The Allied Seawind Ketch, designed by Gillmer in 1962, was the first fiberglass-hulled yacht to circumnavigate the Earth. Gillmer designed and built his own house in Annapolis in 1947, where he lived for more than 60 years. He was married for 62 years to the former Anna Derge. After her death in 1999, he married Ruth Newsome, who was his wife until he died on December 16, 2009.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Thomas_C._Gillmer", "word_count": 395, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Thomas C.

Across several minor league seasons during the late 1980s and early 1990s, he played in many games, posting a batting average around .210 with approximately two dozen home runs. His minor league slugging percentage was about .300. He also briefly pitched for an independent team, allowing one run in less than one inning. During his minor league career, he occasionally played first base.

He played most of his career for Serie A club Internazionale, from 1995 to 2014, and served as their captain from 1999, earning him the nickname \\\"Il Capitano\\\" (The Captain). Known for his versatility, he was adept on both the left and right wing, having played on both flanks as a full-back, as well as a winger. He could also play as a defensive midfielder. On retiring, the club retired his number 4 jersey and named him as Vice President. Known as \\\"Pupi\\\" in Argentina, Zanetti was born in Buenos Aires, picking up the nickname \\\"El Tractor\\\" (The Tractor) soon after his move to Italy where his strength, resilience, stamina, and his ability to run past opposing defenders when joining the attack from his right back position earned him reverence. Zanetti won several honours with Inter, including five Serie A and four Coppa Italia titles. The 2010 UEFA Champions League Final on 22 May 2010 was Zanetti's 700th game with Inter, and the team's victory on the night made him the only captain to win a treble with an Italian club.

{"text": "Fu Zhongwen (1903–1994) was a respected t'ai chi ch'uan teacher and author from China. From an early age, he had been a disciple of Yang Chengfu, and later a family member as he married Zou Kuei Cheng, the great-granddaughter of Yang Chien Hou. Fu Zhongwen was born in Yongnian, Hebei province. As a child, he would watch people practise t'ai chi and imitate their moves before beginning his training with Master Yang Chengfu at the young age of 9. Zhongwen’s personal diligence and application in learning t'ai chi ch'uan saw him advance rapidly in the knowledge and expertise of t'ai chi. As Zhongwen matured, he accompanied Yang in his travels around China from Wuhan to Guangzhou, demonstrating t'ai chi and helping to teach along the way. Yang Chengfu would teach and Zhongwen would demonstrate. Fu Zhongwen would often accept challenges from other martial artists, not once failing to uphold his master's honour. Fu Zhongwen was often called upon by his master to represent him in pushing hands competitions and he earned the reputation of being an undefeatable opponent. So highly regarded was he by his peers, that Yang's first disciple Chen Weiming wrote a letter to him after Chengfu's death, acknowledging the excellence of Zhongwen's accomplishment and the accuracy with which he reflected their master’s art. In 1944, Fu Zhongwen founded the Yongnian Tai Chi Association in order to carry on the work of his master in spreading t'ai chi ch'uan to all people. When he founded the Yongnian Association, he selected diligence, perseverance, respect, and sincerity as their motto. Fu Zhongwen lived his life according to the above motto. The reason he chose Yongnian as the name was because Yong Nian in Chinese means longevity - the main purpose of establishing the association was to teach T'ai chi, allowing the people to benefit from practicing t'ai chi to live longer. In 1959, the PRC featured Fu Zhongwen’s t'ai chi sabre in its international sports publication. The PRC also published his book, entitled \\\"Yang Family Tai Chi Chuan\\\" in 1963. In 1972, the Tongji University in Shanghai carried out a scientific research on the therapeutic value of t'ai chi on patients with Fu Zhongwen and his son Fu Sheng Yuan as instructors. After 3 months, the results achieved with some medical conditions including heart diseases, spleen dysfunction, arthritis and insomnia. This propelled the Ministry of Sports to officially recognize the therapeutic value of T'ai chi. Fu Zhongwen was the type of man who was willing to teach t'ai chi to whom ever wanted to learn for free; the only benefit to him was the knowledge that people were doing t'ai chi and gaining health from it. Fu Zhongwen is a true legacy in the t'ai chi world. Fu Zhongwen had dedicated his life to practicing and teaching T'ai chi. He was voted as one of the One Hundred Living Treasures of China and it was a great loss to the martial arts world and a greater loss to his family when he died in Shanghai on September 25, 1994 at age 92.

He played collegiately at the University of Alabama. Shipley batted and threw right-handed; he stood 6 feet 1 inch (1.85 m) tall, and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg) (12 stone 7). He helped the Padres win the 1996 National League Western Division championship, appearing in 33 games played — 21 after 31 July — and batting .315 with 29 hits, five doubles, one home run, seven runs batted in and seven stolen bases.

Born in Colchester, Connecticut, Green attended the public schools in Malden, Illinois, and Princeton High School in Princeton, Illinois. He was graduated from Oberlin College at Oberlin, Ohio, in 1879. Rather than graduating from a law school, he studied law with the firm McCoy and Pratt. He was admitted to the bar in 1882 and commenced practice in Dow City, Iowa. Two years later, he moved his office to Audubon, Iowa. He served as judge of the district court in the fifteenth judicial district of Iowa from 1894 until 1911, when he resigned to run in a special election for Congress. In 1911, Representative Walter I. Smith of Iowa's 9th congressional district resigned, forcing a special election for his permanent replacement. Green ran as a Republican, and was sworn in on June 5, 1911 as a member of the Sixty-second Congress. Green was reelected eight times, serving in the Sixty-third Congress and to the seven succeeding Congresses. He served as chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means from the Sixty-eighth through the Seventieth Congresses. Green was considered a moderate Republican who worked well as Ways and Means Committee chair with President Calvin Coolidge's Secretary of the Treasury, Andrew W. Mellon. Mellon's primary legislative objectives during Green's tenure involved tax reductions. Green resigned from Congress after his eighth re-election, when President Calvin Coolidge nominated him on February 20, 1928 as a judge of the United States Court of Claims. In all, Green served in Congress from June 5, 1911, to March 31, 1928. His seat was filled through a special election that coincided with the 1928 primary election, in which Republican Earl W. Vincent was elected. Green was the third consecutive Representative of Iowa's ninth congressional district who resigned in the middle of their term to accept appointment to the federal bench. At the time of his judicial appointment, Green was over 71 years old. He served twelve years as a judge with the Court of Claims from April 1, 1928, until May 29, 1940, when he resigned. He was later recalled and served until June 1942. Green retired from active pursuits and resided at Bellport, New York, until his death there on June 11, 1947. He was interred in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Giovanni Carrara Jiménez (born March 4, 1968) is a retired Major League Baseball pitcher. Carrara bats and throws right-handed.

{"text": "Giulio Cabianca (February 19, 1923 – June 15, 1961) was a Formula One driver from Italy. Cabianca was born in Verona, northern Italy. He participated in 4 World Championship Grands Prix, debuting on May 18, 1958. He scored a total of 3 championship points. He also participated in one non-Championship Formula One race. He also won the Dolomites Gold Cup Race in 1955. Cabianca's death resulted from a bizarre incident at the Modena Autodrome test track in Italy. The Modena Autodrome was situated near Via Emilia, which crosses the city of Modena. Cabianca was testing a Cooper-Ferrari F1 car, owned by Scuderia Castellotti, when he suffered a suspected stuck throttle. Unable to stop, his Cooper went off track, struck a spectator and then went through the gate of the Autodrome which was open because of men at work near the track. The car crossed the Via Emilia and crashed against the wall of a workshop. Crossing the road, Cabianca's Cooper struck a bicycle, a motorcycle, and a small mini-van (not a taxi as often reported) and three parked cars.

In the beginning he produced cigarette machines, beverage machines and other electronic machinery. In 1904 he produced his first motorcycle, the Elleham motorcycle. In 1903–1904 Jacob Ellehammer used his experience constructing motorcycles to build the world's first air-cooled radial engine, a three-cylinder engine which he used as the basis for a more powerful five-cylinder model in 1907. This was installed in his triplane and made a number of short free-flight hops as mentioned below. In 1905, he constructed a monoplane, and in the following year a \\\"semi-biplane\\\". In this latter machine, he made a tethered flight on 12 September 1906. Ellehammer's later inventions included a successful triplane and helicopter. His helicopter was a coaxial machine. A famous photo shows it hovering in 1914, though there is no evidence that it was successful in achieving translational flight.

He attended McKeesport Area High School (in Pennsylvania) and Arizona State University before being drafted by the NBA's Cincinnati Royals in 1966. After one season of limited playing time with the Royals, he moved to the rival ABA, spending the next seven seasons with the Indiana Pacers. Though players like Roger Brown and Mel Daniels received more attention from Indiana fans, Lewis was a solid contributor on three Pacers teams that won the ABA Championship (in 1970, 1972, and 1973). He also represented the Pacers in three All-Star games (1968, 1970, and 1972).

He became homesick and joined Sheffield United. A prolific goalscorer, he had two spells (1975–1978 and 1981–1986) at Sheffield United for whom he scored 171 goals in 293 appearances. Whilst with the Blades, he was the highest scoring player in a division twice, scoring 36 goals (one for Hull City) in Division 4 in 1981–82 and 33 goals in Division 3 in 1983–84. The latter haul earned Edwards his second Adidas Golden Boot award. His debut for United came in a FA Cup Third Round Tie against Leicester City on 3 January 1976 and his League debut came on 28 February 1976 in a Division 1 game against Queens Park Rangers. However, his first goal didn't arrive until the next season in Division 2 against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 24 August 1976. In between his time at Bramall Lane he played for Hull City who paid £50,000 for Edwards in 1978. Ian Porterfield bought him back for £100,000 and played him for the first time against Scunthorpe United on 26 September 1981, the 1–0 home victory being the first of a 17-game unbeaten run. Edwards scored his first two goals under Porterfield in a 4–0 win over Crewe Alexandra three days later. He formed an impressive partnership with Bob Hatton, feeding off the distribution of Colin Morris as United ended the season with 19 games without defeat to win the Fourth Division Championship, his 35 goals being a post-war record.

{"text": "Charles George Male (8 May 1910 – 19 February 1998) was an English footballer. Born in West Ham, London, Male trialled with West Ham United before playing with non-league Clapton. He joined Arsenal as an amateur in November 1929, turning professional in May 1930 and made his debut in a 7-1 victory over Blackpool on 27 December 1930. Initially a left-winger or left-half, usually deputising for Bob John. Male's appearances were few and far between - three in 1930-31 (in which Arsenal won the First Division for the first time in their history) and nine in 1931-32, although he was a surprise choice at left half in the 1932 FA Cup final after Alex James was withdrawn because of injury and the side reshuffled as a result. Arsenal controversially lost 2-1 to Newcastle United, after Newcastle's equaliser had come after the ball had already gone behind for a goal kick. In 1932, with Arsenal's current right back Tom Parker ageing and his replacement, Leslie Compton, not looking entirely assured, Male was converted from left half to right back by Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman; Male would later recount how, before being told of the switch by Chapman, he entered his office fearing for his future at the club, but Chapman convinced him not only could he play at right back, but that he was the best right back in the country. Bolstered by Chapman's pep talk, Male slotted into the right back role easily, and he became a near ever-present for the next seven seasons; he was undisputed first-choice right back and played over 35 matches for every season in that period. During that time, Arsenal won the First Division four more times (1932-33, 1933-34, 1934-35 and 1937-38), as well as the FA Cup in 1935-36. Male's performances for club soon meant he was an international; he made his debut for England against Scotland on 14 November 1934 and went on to win nineteen caps for his country, captaining the team for six of them. By the end of the 1930s, Male was Arsenal captain, although injuries restricted his appearances in 1938-39. However, World War II intervened when Male was 29 and at the peak of his career; he played nearly 200 wartime matches for Arsenal, as well as serving in the Royal Air Force in Palestine. Upon the resumption of League football Male was 36, but still played 8 times in Arsenal's 1947-48 First Division-winning season, and thus became the first player in League history to play in six title-winning seasons. His last match for Arsenal was an 8-0 victory over Grimsby Town in May 1948. In all he played 318 matches for the Gunners, though he never scored a goal. After retiring from playing, Male became a coach at Arsenal, training the youth and reserve teams. He was later a scout, discovering, amongst others, Charlie George. He was still at the club to see it win its first Double in 1970-71, before retiring finally in 1975; he later emigrated to Canada to live with his son. Although at the time of his death in February 1998, at the age of 87, he was reported as being the last survivor of the Herbert Chapman era, Ray Bowden survived until September that year, and to a greater age (89).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "SoccerPlayer", "wiki_name": "George_Male", "word_count": 548, "label": "Soccer Player", "people": "George Male", "personality": {"birth_year": 1910, "sex": "male", "birth_city_country": "West Ham, London, England", "education_level": null, "occupation": "footballer", "income_level": "middle"}, "anonymized_response": "A professional athlete began their career after trialing with a community club before playing with a lower-level team.

{"text": "Shōgō Kuniba (February 5, 1935 - July 14, 1992) was a Japanese teacher of karate and iaido His adoptive father (biological uncle) was Kōsei Kokuba, who began training him at the age of five years. Kuniba was taught by many masters of the day including: \\n* Kenwa Mabuni - Shitō-ryū Karate \\n* Kōsei Kokuba - Motobu-ha Karate-dō \\n* Itoh Asakichi - Judo \\n* Ishii Gogetsu - Mugai-ryū Iaido \\n* Shōshin Nagamine - Shōrin-ryū Karate \\n* Kenko Nakaima - Kobudō \\n* Kosha Shojin - Bō and nunchaku \\n* Junko Yamaguchi - Tonfa \\n* Shioda Gozo - Aikido \\n* Ryusei Tomoyori - Kenyu-ryū Karate When he was 24 years old, Shōgō Kuniba became the youngest karate system head (Sōke) in Japan, taking over the style his adoptive father (Kōsei Kokuba) had inherited from Motobu Chōki. He thus became the Sandai Soke of Ryukyu Karate Motobu-ha (Choki Motobu was Shodai Soke; Kosei Kokuba was Nidai Soke). Kuniba was known for integrating the power of karate with the sensitivity of aikido and other traditional martial arts, in a style he called \\\"Motobu-ha Shito-ryu.\\\" This style is structured to adopt concepts and techniques from other styles to form a modern system replete with traditional values, but with an open-minded philosophy. Shogo Kuniba was the Shodai Soke of Motobu-ha Shito-ryu Karate-do. It is sometimes referred to as Kuniba-ha Karate-do. A book titled A Primer of Kuniba-ha Karate-do: The Style of Shogo Kuniba was written and published in 1985 by James Herndon; it was republished in 2009. At the age of 17, Kuniba started learning Mugai Ryu Iaido from Ishii Gogetsu, a practitioner of Mugai Ryu, himself a student of Nakagawa Shiryo Shinichi, 11th and last headmaster of Mugai Ryu. Kuniba proceeded to practice Mugai Ryu for the next 40 years. However, the style of Mugai Ryu, as taught by Ishii Gogetsu and then modified by Kuniba is sufficiently different from other branches of Mugai Ryu (Mugai Ryu splintered with the death of the Nakagawa, so no single orthodox line exists), that this branch of Mugai Ryu is commonly known as Kuniba Ryu. Amongst the most noticeable differences, are addition of kata not present in Mugai Ryu, that are thought to be added by both Ishii Gogetsu and Shōgō Kuniba. Kuniba applied his knowledge of aikido, jujutsu, judo and other arts to the bunkai of karate kata. This made for very creative variations on techniques, which became his hallmark. He created a new style, Kuniba-ryū Goshindō (aka Goshin Budō Jujutsu), which literally means Kuniba's style of self-defense. In Japan, Shōgō Kuniba was treated as a Meijin (brilliant man). When Kuniba died on July 14, 1992, the organizations he had led split over leadership disagreements. Kunio Tatsuno became Sōke of Motobu-Ha Karate-dō and Kaicho of Seishinkai. In the U.S., Kuniba named William H. Price as second Sōke of both Kuniba-ryu Karate-Do and Kuniba-ryū Goshindō on March 16, 1992. Several American karateka under Kuniba followed his named U.S. successor. Chikubu-Kai was created on September 8, 1995, to continue his teachings. However, upon the death of Kunio Tatsuno, Kuniba-Kai was established in Japan by the Kuniba family in 1999. Many Shihan loyal to Kuniba have affiliated with Kuniba-Kai, headed by Kozo Kuniba and Kosuke Kuniba. The style is called Kuniba-ryu Karate-Do in the U.S. and Motobu-Ha Shitō-ryū in Japan. Today, the Seishinkai (the Karate organization originally started by Kosei Kokuba) still exists to promote Shitō-ryū (however, the term \\\"Motobu-Ha\\\" is no longer claimed). A new International Seishinkai Karate-dō Union (ISKU) was formed by Kunio Tatsuno in 1999; in 2007, Sadatomu Harada formed the Seishinkai International Shitoryu Karate-dō Union (SISKU). Neither ISKU nor SISKU claim Motobu-Ha. Kuniba-Kai has exclusive rights to that style per the Japan Karate Federation (JKF).

A new self-defense style was created, literally meaning \"style of self-defense.\" In Japan, this individual was regarded as a Meijin (brilliant person).\n\nWhen the instructor passed away in the late 20th century, the organizations they had led divided due to leadership disagreements. Different successors were appointed to lead various branches in Japan and the United States during the early 1990s. Several American practitioners followed their designated U.S. successor. New organizations were established in the mid-1990s to continue these teachings. After the death of one Japanese successor, another organization was established in Japan by the family in the late 1990s. Many senior instructors loyal to the original master affiliated with this family-led organization, headed by family members. The style is known by different names in the U.S. and Japan.\n\nToday, the original karate organization still exists to promote its core style, though it no longer uses the previous branch designation. New international unions were formed in the late 1990s and 2000s, neither of which claim the original branch lineage. The family-led organization maintains exclusive rights to that style according to Japanese martial arts authorities.\n\nA quotation by this martial arts master states, \"Seven Times Down, Eight Times Up!", "loss_description_sentence": "The person was Japanese and specifically taught Shitō-ryū and Motobu-ha karate, Mugai-ryū iaido, and created Kuniba-ryū Goshindō."}

Pierre's grandfather, Louis-François Cartier (1819–1904) had taken over the jewellery workshop of his teacher, Adolphe Picard, in 1847, thereby founding the famous Cartier jewellery company. Jacques worked with his two older brothers to create the world famous name and business, ‘Cartier’, in jewellery and watches. While Jaqcues Cartier opened and managed the store in London, Pierre Cartier managed the store in New York City. Jacques took charge of the London operation of Cartier in 1909 and eventually moved to the current location at 175 New Bond Street. Meanwhile, Louis Cartier was the designer who created the Cartier style we know today. The brothers divided and conquered. Cartier was very lucky in getting the recommendation of Princess Mathilde, the young cousin of Napoleon III, and this contributed to the boosting business. In the early 1900s, \\\"Cartier became jewellers to the Rockefellers, Vanderbilts, the Fords, the Morgans, King Edward VII, King Zog of Albania, and King Chulalongkorn of Siam, who, in 1907 alone, according to Cartier biographer Hans Nadelhoffer, bought Cartier bracelets to the value of $450,000.\\\" Through their continued successes, Louis and Pierre got married, while Jacques kept himself busy by fulfilling royal needs and desires and trips abroad in search of unique and exceptional beauty in gems. Jacques went to the Persian Gulf to find the perfect pearl. Jacques then proceeded to India, carrying magnificent jewellery of local maharajahs back to the London studio to redesign and modify for their own use. Together, Pierre and Jacques purchased a large number of pearls and precious stones from an Indian prince. The uniqueness of the pearls and stones created a sense of each piece of jewellery being special, which helped with the success of their business.

Cook and Harriet Bickersteth Cook. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1893 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and from St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1895 as a Bachelor of Medicine. He became a Doctor of Medicine in 1901. In 1896, Albert Cook went to Uganda with a Church Missionary Society mission, and in 1897 he established Mengo Hospital, the oldest hospital in East Africa. In 1899 he was joined by his older brother John Howard Cook, a surgeon and ophthalmologist. Albert Cook married Katharine Timpson, a missionary nurse, in 1900, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Katharine Timpson, who later became Katharine, Lady Cook was matron of Mengo Hospital 1897–1911, and the General Superintendent of Midwives, and Inspector of Country Centres.

During the 1920s his paintings, primarily portraits of working-class subjects, were influenced by the work of Otto Dix.

He returned to Florence with a letter of recommendation of Cardinal Gozzadini seeking patronage from Cosimo III de' Medici. He found work in the studio of Tommaso Redi and Sebastiano Galeotti. He travelled to Bologna to work under Felice Torelli and then resettled in Florence in 1715. Ferretti soon joined the Florentine Accademia del Disegno, where he later taught painting but also designed tapestries for the Medici. He found abundant patronage in fresco painting for the Florentine Abbey (Badia Fiorentina), the Chapel of San Giuseppe in the Duomo, and the altar and cupola of the Church of San Salvatore al Vescovo. One of his most important works was the decoration of the ceiling of the Church of Santa Maria del Carmine, since lost in a fire. Ferretti's fresco style was influenced by Sebastiano Ricci's lively, colourful, and pastel-hued frescoes in the Palazzo Marucelli-Fenzi.

Doak's main pitch, the spitball, earned him the nickname \\\"Spittin' Bill\\\". When the pitch was outlawed in 1920, Doak was one of 17 pitchers allowed to continue throwing the spitball. Doak made his most lasting contribution to baseball by innovating the design of the baseball glove. In 1920, he suggested to Rawlings that a web should be laced between the first finger and thumb, saying it would create a natural pocket. The Bill Doak glove soon replaced all other baseball gloves and is the standard to this day.

Taylor (1901–1989), chairman of a giant business conglomerate, the founder of the Jockey Club of Canada, and later the president of the National Thoroughbred Racing Association. Taylor hired Luro to run his Windfields Farm, a large breeding and racing operation with two farms in Ontario and another in Chesapeake City, Maryland. In a career that spanned 48 years from 1937 to 1984, Luro trained 43 Stakes winners and 3 Champions. He won the 1962 Kentucky Derby with California-bred Decidedly and two years later won both the Derby and the Preakness Stakes with Northern Dancer, a horse who went on to be the 20th century's greatest sire.

{"text": "Asa Leonard Allen (January 5, 1891 – January 5, 1969) was an educator, attorney, and member of the United States House of Representatives from the state of Louisiana. He served eight terms as a Democrat from 1937 to 1953, having represented the now defunct Eighth Congressional District, centered about Alexandria. Allen was born in a log cabin near Winnfield, the seat of Winn Parish, to Asa L. Allen and the former Sophronia Perkins. He was a younger brother of Governor Oscar Kelly Allen. He was educated in the Winn Parish public schools and received a bachelor's degree from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge in 1914. The next year, he married the former Lottie Mae Thompson, and they had two sons, Harwell L. Allen, who became a district judge, and Lyndon Blaine Allen. Allen taught in the rural schools of neighboring Grant Parish from 1914 to 1917. He was a principal in schools in Georgetown and Verda near Montgomery. Thereafter, he became the superintendent of the Winn Parish system, 1917-1922. He studied law on his own, was admitted to the bar in 1922, and practiced in Winnfield, where he was city attorney for a time. Allen was a prominent Baptist, who served a stint as vice-president of the Louisiana Baptist Convention. He was a Scottish Rite Mason and a Shriner. He died in Winnfield on his 78th birthday and is interred at Winnfield Cemetery. While he first ran for Congress, Allen was also a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1936, which renominated the Franklin D. Roosevelt and John Nance Garner ticket, an overwhelming winner in Louisiana and nationwide as well. In Congress, Allen served as chairman of the Committee on the Census. A loyal member of the Long organization, he did not seek a ninth term in Congress in 1952. Instead, he deferred to George Shannon \\\"Doc\\\" Long, the older brother of the legendary Huey Pierce Long, Jr., and Earl Kemp Long, who desired to run for Allen's Eighth District seat. In 1943, Allen was among the US representatives who opposed the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act. In 1994, Allen was posthumously inducted into the Louisiana Political Museum and Hall of Fame in Winnfield. His brother had been an original inductee a year earlier. Allen died on his 78th birthday.

Born in Archer City in Archer County, a part of the Wichita Falls metropolitan statistical area, Purcell attended public schools and received his Bachelor of Science from the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas in 1946, and his LL.B. in 1949 from Baylor Law School in Waco, Texas. Purcell served in the United States Army during World War II from 1941 to 1946 and served thereafter in the United States Army Reserve.He served as judge of the Eighty-ninth Judicial District Court of Texas from 1955 to 1962. He was a delegate to the 1960 and 1964 Democratic national conventions, which met in Los Angeles and Atlantic City, New Jersey, respectively to nominate the Kennedy-Johnson and the Johnson-Humphrey tickets, both of which prevailed in Texas. Purcell was elected to the Eighty-seventh Congress, by special election, to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of fellow Democrat, Representative Frank N. Ikard. He was reelected to the five succeeding congresses (January 27, 1962 – January 3, 1973). In 1966, when John Tower won his second term as U.

{"text": "David Frye (November 21, 1933 – January 24, 2011) was an American comedian, specializing in comic imitations of famous political figures, most of whom were based on notable Americans, including former U.S. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon, Vice Presidents Spiro Agnew and Nelson Rockefeller, Senators Hubert Humphrey and Bobby Kennedy, as well as film celebrities, e.g., George C. Scott, Henry Fonda, Kirk Douglas, Robert Mitchum, Jack Nicholson and Jack Palance, and media figures, e.g., William F. Buckley Jr. and Larry King. However, as eerily accurate and subtle as his impersonations were, the comedic narratives spoken by those depicted by Frye were outrageously à propos as well as politically savvy and au courant. For example, in one narrative, Frye had newly elected Nixon and his wife visit the White House just prior to assuming residency there in 1969. The incumbent Johnson answers the doorbell, oblivious as to the identity of his unannounced visitors, misidentifying them even after introductions have been made: [Doorbell rings]Johnson: \\\"I'll get it, Lady Bird! Who's there?\\\"Nixon: \\\"It's Dick and Pat.\\\"Johnson (shouting): \\\"It's Pick 'n Pat!\\\"Nixon: \\\"No, it's Dick and Pat: The President Elect ... and Mrs. Elect.\\\"Johnson: \\\"I understand.\\\"Johnson (shouting back): \\\"Company, Lady Bird! Beautify yourself!\\\" Another, from a February 1971 appearance on NBC's Kraft Music Hall, had him appearing in two segments. In the first, he portrayed Humphrey as a drug store owner (harkening back to Humphrey's original vocation) being interviewed by show host Eddy Arnold. The latter segment had Frye impersonating Nixon, William F. Buckley, Jr., George Jessel, Truman Capote and Liberace at a Valentine's Day party. Frye's Nixon often keyed off the President's own catchphrases (\\\"Let me make one thing perfectly clear\\\", \\\"Let me say this about that\\\", etc.) In 1973, Frye's album, Richard Nixon: A Fantasy, which dealt with Nixon's Watergate troubles, developed marketing problems when all three network affiliates in New York City (WNBC-TV, WABC-TV and WCBS-TV) rejected commercials promoting the album, citing questions of taste. In addition, the Woolworth's department store chain decided not to stock the record because, in their words, \\\"some of our customers might be offended.\\\" Though his heyday was in the 1960s and early 1970s, when his Lyndon B. Johnson was definitive and he vied with Rich Little as the premier Nixon impersonator, Frye continued to create masterful new impressions and evolve old ones. His 1998 album Clinton: An Oral History featured riffs on Bill Clinton, Al Gore, Pat Buchanan, and John McLaughlin, plus that of an older Nixon (complete with pauses and phrasing more typical of the ex-President as he sounded in the 1980s and 1990s).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Comedian", "wiki_name": "David_Frye", "word_count": 432, "label": "Comedian", "people": "David Frye", "personality": {"birth_year": 1933, "sex": "male", "birth_city_country": null, "education_level": null, "occupation": "comedian", "income_level": "middle"}, "anonymized_response": "A celebrated entertainer known for humorous portrayals of well-known public figures, including former heads of state and their deputies, legislators, as well as film stars and media personalities.

{"text": "In the 1934 Tour de France, Vietto, a relative unknown, got wings on the mountains. This was not a surprise, because he had won the Grand Prix Wolber. He was prepared for the Alps and won easily on the steepest terrain. After he won the two major Alpine stages, journalists reported that this 'boy' could be the purest mountain climber that France knew. During the 1934 Tour, he was poised to be race leader after his team leader Antonin Magne crashed during stage 16. Vietto was unaware of Magne's situation; his advantage gave him the virtual race lead. A marshal on a motorcycle caught Vietto to inform him his captain was on the side of the road, with team-mate Lapébie ahead, and the other team-mates behind the yellow jersey. Vietto turned and rode back up the mountain into the descending riders (at the time, reversing course was legal, but is no longer so), to give Magne his bike. Magne mounted Vietto's bike and with Lapébie closed the gap to preserve his overall lead and win the Tour. A photograph shows Vietto sitting on a stone wall as the race passes. This made him a star in France. The image of a 20-year-old who sacrificed his chance of winning the Tour doubled his popularity. Vietto was nevertheless named the Tour's best climber; he finished 5th overall, almost 1 hour behind Magne. Vietto never won the Tour. He was closest in 1939, when he gained the yellow jersey in Lorient in one of the first stages, but in the mountains, once his favorite place, he was left by Sylvère Maes. After that Tour, war broke out and the race wasn't held until 1947. Vietto, still loved, attacked from the second stage. As a result, he took the yellow jersey in Brussels, to lose it a day before the finish, in a time trial of 139 km. Despite failing to hold the lead, Vietto wore the yellow jersey for 15 stages during the 1938 Tour de France and during the 1947 Tour de France for 14 stages. He finished second in 1939, fifth in 1934 and 1947 and eighth in 1935. Until Fabian Cancellara broke his record in the 2012 Tour de France, Vietto had the highest career yellow jersey statistics of anyone to never win the Tour de France overall. Vietto lost a toe to sepsis in 1947. Legend has it that Vietto insisted his domestique, Apo Lazarides, cut off one of his own toes to match.

Moore II (June 22, 1953 – April 21, 2002) was a New York-based painter, winner of the Logan Medal of the arts, and a member of the Visual AIDS Artist Caucus—the organization responsible for the (Red) Ribbon Project, A Day Without Art, and A Night Without Light. Moore's father, Earle K. Moore, was a communications and civil rights lawyer in Manhattan, who won a landmark case establishing that broadcast stations must serve the interests of their viewers. His sister, Rebecca Moore, would become a computer scientist, environmentalist, and founder of Google Earth Outreach. Frank Moore was born in Manhattan in 1953, then moved with his family to Long Island, N.Y., first to Great Neck, and then to Roslyn, where he first attended Roslyn Junior High School. He graduated from Roslyn High School in 1971, where he had been active in student politics and served as class president. Moore's work was selected for display for years in the high school halls. They were eventually removed during a renovation and subsequently lost. He attended Yale, where he graduated summa cum laude in 1975, and he studied at the Cité Internationale des Arts in Paris from 1977 to 1979. His art began appearing in group exhibitions in 1979, as he worked as a set designer for modern dance choreographer Jim Self in Manhattan. Deeply indebted to Surrealism, Moore's paintings frequently depict dream scenarios and futuristic landscapes, often with environmental sub-texts (in a picture-postcard Niagara Falls, chemical signatures of pollutants drift in the mist), or references to AIDS (in Viral Romance, 1992, a reversed bouquet blooms human immunodeficiency virus). His political stance was broad and nuanced with homoerotic imagery. He died of AIDS on April 21, 2002, aged 48. Late in 2012, the double exhibition Toxic Beauty, comprising the most comprehensive review of Moore's work, was on view at New York University.

{"text": "Christopher C. Faust (born 1955 in Fort Riley, Kansas) is a prolific landscape photographer in St. Paul, Minnesota. He holds a degree in biology from St. Cloud State University and an MS in Educational Media from St. Cloud State University. He is best known for his panoramic photographs of landscapes. From 1990 to 1996 he created a series of black-and-white images of new suburban development, especially in Minnesota, USA. Many of these depict new structures and spaces not yet fully formed, and not yet inhabited by people. A frequent theme in these and other series is the intersection of human beings with nature, and places where the two interact in visually provocative ways. An example is \\\"The Edge, Eden Prairie, MN\\\" which is in the collection of the Walker Art Center. This photograph appears to be a split, double image, but is actually a single scene, depicting where a suburban development near Minneapolis, Minnesota runs up against prairie vegetation. The imported, landscaped vegetation, especially the central tree, conifers, and lawn grass balance the smaller native tree and prairie grass of the other half, as the condominiums loom from a corner. Other of his series include outdoor industrial scenes typical of the northern Midwest, like grain elevators and railcars, rural landscapes from Minnesota and Appalachia, and color photographs of natural scenes. Faust's work is exhibited regularly in galleries around Minnesota. His work appears in a number of restaurants and coffee shops in the St. Paul area, and is held by the permanent collections of the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Weisman Art Museum, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Twenty of Faust's photographs, many of them from his Suburban Documentation Project, illustrate the 1997 book Placing Nature: Culture and Landscape Ecology, edited by landscape architect Joan Iverson Nassauer, and including essays by novelist Jane Smiley and philosopher Marcia Muelder Eaton. Faust has been honored with McKnight Foundation Fellowships in 1989, 1992, and 1997. Faust is now a media teacher at a catholic school in South Minneapolis.

{"text": "Karl Kling (16 September 1910, Gießen – 18 March 2003, Gaienhofen on Lake Constance, Germany) was a motor racing driver and manager from Germany. He participated in 11 Formula One Grands Prix, debuting on 4 July 1954. He achieved 2 podiums, and scored a total of 17 championship points. It is said, that he was born too late and too early. Too late to be in the successful Mercedes team of the 1930s and too early to have a real chance in 1954 and 1955. Unusually, Kling found his way into motorsport via his first job as a reception clerk at Daimler-Benz in the mid-1930s, competing in hillclimb and trials events in production machinery in his spare time. During the Second World War he gained mechanical experience servicing Luftwaffe aircraft, and after the cessation of hostilities he resumed his motorsport involvement in a BMW 328. Kling was instrumental in developing Mercedes' return to international competition in the early 1950s, and his win in the 1952 Carrera Panamericana road race, driving the then-experimental Mercedes-Benz 300SL was a defining point in assuring the Daimler-Benz management that motorsport had a place in Mercedes' future. Called up to the revived Mercedes Grand Prix squad in 1954 he finished less than one second behind the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio on his Formula One debut, taking second place in the 1954 French Grand Prix at the fast Reims-Gueux circuit. This promising start was not to last, and with the arrival of Stirling Moss at Mercedes in 1955 Kling was effectively demoted to third driver. However, away from the World Championship, Kling took impressive victories in both the Berlin Grand Prix (at AVUS, another high-speed circuit) and the Swedish Grand Prix. He left the Formula One team at the end of the season, to succeed Alfred Neubauer as head of Mercedes motorsport.

He was christened Richard Paul, but later legally changed his name to Mike. Palm was signed by the Red Sox while still in high school. The family moved to Belmont after Palm finished ninth grade at Belmont High School. Often striking out as many as 18 batters in a game, he earned an invitation to one of the school prospects tryouts that Hall of Famer Hugh Duffy hosted at Fenway Park. Assigned to the Allentown team of the Interstate League after graduation and awaiting induction into the Army, Palm saw only a couple of weeks of duty.

He is a former one-term Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina. Cobey was born in Washington, D.C. and reared in the suburb of University Park in Prince George's County, Maryland. His father, William W. Cobey, Sr., was the athletic director for the University of Maryland from 1956 to 1969. Cobey is a graduate of Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Chemistry. Cobey also earned an M.B.A. in Marketing from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia and an M.Ed. from the University of Pittsburgh. Cobey originally worked as a bank administrative assistant and then as a chemical salesman. In 1968, he became, like his father, an athletic administrator. From 1976 to 1980, he was athletic director at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In the early 1980s, he was the president of his own corporation, Cobey & Associates. In 1980, Cobey was the Republican nominee for North Carolina Lieutenant Governor. In 1984, he was elected to represent North Carolina's 4th congressional district in the U.S. Congress. However, he was defeated in a bid for re-election in 1986 by the Democrat David Price. After serving in Congress, Cobey joined the administration of North Carolina Governor James G. Martin, first as Deputy Secretary of Transportation and then as Secretary of the Department of Environment, Health and Natural Resources. After serving as town manager of Morrisville, North Carolina, he did government relations consulting for Capitol Link, Inc. Cobey served two terms (1999–2003) as the voluntary chairman of the North Carolina Republican Party. Under Cobey's leadership, the state party purchased a new headquarters building. Cobey was one of the leading candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination to challenge Democratic Governor Mike Easley in the 2004 election. In July 2003, Cobey received the endorsement of former North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms in the Republican primary contest. Rarely had Helms endorsed any candidate in primaries, other than Ronald W. Reagan for the 1976 presidential nomination. In the July 2004 Republican primary, Cobey ran a strong third with 26.7% of the vote (97,461 votes), lagging behind nominee Patrick Ballantine (30.3% and 110,726 votes) and Richard Vinroot (29.9% and 109,217 votes). In 2007-2008, Cobey was the North Carolina campaign chairman for defeated presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, the former governor of Arkansas. From 2005-2012, Cobey was a presidential-appointee to the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Board of Directions, which governs Reagan National and Dulles Airports. He is a former chairman of the board at Trinity School of Durham and Chapel Hill and a former president of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro YMCA.

He batted and threw right-handed. A native of Kyle, Texas, Hughson played collegiately at the University of Texas at Austin. He was a successful and competitive major league pitcher who was not averse to throwing close to batters, changing speeds by mixing a hard fastball with an overhand curveball. At the height of his career, arm and shoulder injuries threatened permanent disability and hastened his retirement. Hughson enjoyed his best season in 1942, posting a 22–6 record with a 2.59 ERA, and also leading the league in victories, strikeouts (113), complete games (22), innings pitched (281.0) and batters faced (1150). In 1943, he won 12 games with 114 strikeouts and a 2.64 ERA, and again led the league in complete games (20). He also had his best year batting, posting career highs in hits, runs, doubles, walks, batting average and RBI's. He led the league in winning percentage ( 18-5,.783) and WHIP (9.43), and also had a career-best ERA of 2.26. After serving in the military in 1945, he won 20 games in 1946, led the league in walks per nine innings (1.65), set a career high in strikeouts with 172, and completed 21 of 35 starts. His several 1-0 shutouts led to an early pennant-clinching for the Red Sox. But he fell to 12 wins in 1947, and finished his career when only 33 after two seasons in relief. In an eight-year career, he posted a 96–54 won-lost record with 693 strikeouts and a 2.94 ERA in 1375.2 innings. His control was good enough for an effective 1.86 strikeout-to-walk ratio (693-to-372). He was an American League All-Star for three consecutive years (1942–44). After retirement from baseball, he joined his dad and uncle at Hughson Meat Company in San Marcos, Texas in the 1950s. Sometime in the 1990s, after the slaughter plant's closure, the 40 acres of land it had occupied were designated as greenspace and are now known as Ringtail Ridge Natural Area. The foundations of the plant and other artifacts can still be seen. He was one of the first in the United States to raise Charolois cattle. He served on the local school Board of Trustees in the 1950s where he was one who led the effort to integrate the public schools. In the 60's he developed part of his ranch into the Hughson Heights subdivision. He died in San Marcos at age 77, and is buried in San Marcos Cemetery.

He had trained at Star City, Moscow in Russia to fly with two members of Expedition 14 on board Soyuz TMA-9, which was launched on September 18, 2006. However, on August 21, 2006, a Russian Federal Space Agency spokesman announced that Enomoto was \\\"deemed not ready to fly for exclusively medical reasons\\\", although he hinted that Enomoto might recover and join a later mission. His replacement on this particular flight was Iranian-American businesswoman Anousheh Ansari. Enomoto was involved in a lawsuit against Virginia-based Space Adventures in which he hoped to reclaim the $21 million he paid the company over a two-year span. During the lawsuit, it was revealed that the \\\"medical reason\\\" was chronic kidney stones. Space Adventures claims it advised Enomoto to treat the kidney stones aggressively and when he did not, they had to disqualify him from spaceflight. Enomoto claims the real reason for his disqualification was his refusal to provide additional funds to Space Adventures. Enomoto would have been the first self-funded space tourist from Japan and Asia (journalist Toyohiro Akiyama flew on Soyuz TM-11 in 1990, and could be regarded as the first space business traveller). Enomoto's flight would have taken him to the International Space Station (ISS) after lifting off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, the world's oldest spaceport.

Bell commenced his engineering career in 1837, building railways in England and Scotland, and also worked under Sir John Macneill MInstCE, on the Great Southern and Western Railway in Ireland. By 1853 Bell had migrated to Australia, and in January 1854, in Victoria, is the engineer on the £1,000,000 prospectus for the Geelong–Ballarat railway line. He was also listed as the surveyor for the Colonial Insurance Company, and there are a number of tender advertisements, for reinstatement for damaged buildings. In 1855, he presented a well received paper on the merits of iron truss bridges to the Victorian Institute for the Advancement of Science (later the Royal Society of Victoria). Other works he designed included 17 miles of the railway from Newcastle to Maitland, New South Wales prior to 1858, the design and construction of the Melbourne and Essendon Railway in 1859, and works for the Yarra Yarra Mining Company, and Sandridge Lagoon, Port Melbourne. Bell was responsible for a number of fairly similar wrought iron lattice truss road and rail bridges, several of which were fabricated from components supplied by Messrs. Lloyds, Fosters, and Company's Wednesbury, Old Park Ironworks, Staffordshire. The West Maitland Bridge was the sixth bridge this firm exported for Bell, with the others including the Hawthorn Railway Bridge and Hawthorn Road Bridge over the River Yarra, in Melbourne, and the Gundagai, Pitnacree, and Dunmore bridges in New South Wales. His expertise was sought for a number of Melbourne civic works projects as he gave evidence to the Victorian Royal Commissions on the River and Harbour Trust in 1858 and 1860, and to the Select Committees on the Railway Department in 1860 and on the Central Railway Terminus in 1861 and in the same year was a member of the Royal Society of Victoria's Sanitary Committee. Bell was City Engineer for the City of Sydney, Australia from about 1871 to 1879, a member of the Sewerage and Health Board, and was responsible for improving the storage capacity of the Botany watershed and planned a system for sewering the city in the direction of Bondi.

In May 1872 he was living in St. Leonards, on the North Shore of Sydney, when his wife gave birth to a daughter. His youngest daughter married Charles Wade, who, amongst other things, became premier of NSW in 1907, was the Agent-General for NSW in 1917, and was knighted in 1918.

In 1779 he established a foundry and engineering works at Hayle called Harvey & Co. By 1800 the company employed more than 50 people and continued to grow as Harvey worked with many of the great Cornish engineers and entrepreneurs of the day. These included Richard Trevithick, William West, and, more importantly, Arthur Woolf. In 1797, Harvey's daughter, Jane, married Richard Trevithick. Harvey & Co. built up a reputation for world class stationary beam engines designed to pump water out of the deep Cornish tin and copper mines. The Cornish beam engine became world-famous and was exported overseas, and remains the largest type of beam engine ever constructed; the largest of all, with a 144-inch-diameter (3,700 mm) cylinder which powered eight separate beams, was used to drain the Haarlemmermeer in the Netherlands—it is preserved in the Museum De Cruquius. Harvey's also produced a range of products, from hand tools to ocean-going ships including the USS Cornubia. The company was expanded by John's son, Henry, in collaboration with Arthur Woolf, who was the chief engineer. At that time it was the main mining engine foundry in the world, with an international market served through their own port at Foundry Town, Hayle. Harvey's of Hayle reached their peak in the early- to mid-19th century and then, along with the Cornish mining industry in general, suffered a gradual and slow decline.

A native of Greenwich, New Jersey, Wood was educated at the University of Pennsylvania, from which he received his medical degree in 1818. Four years later he became professor of chemistry in the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, and in 1821 took the chair of materia medica in the same institution, which he resigned in 1835 to accept the same branch in the medical department of the University of Pennsylvania. In 1850, having been continuously connected with the latter institution in the position mentioned, he was elected professor of the theory and practice of medicine in the same school, and upon his resigning, in 1860, he was unanimously appointed emeritus professor of the theory and practice of medicine. In 1863 he was made a member of the board of trustees of the university, and in 1865 he instituted and endowed the summer school with an auxiliary faculty, authorized to confer the degree of doctor of philosophy. He was physician to the Pennsylvania Hospital for twenty-four years (1835–59), and was a member of the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania for about the same period. At the time of his death he was president of the College of Physicians of Philadelphia, and president of the American Philosophical Society. He was a member of a number of other societies, and had been president of the American Medical Association. During the last four years he had been an invalid and confined to his house, the last two years being unable to leave his couch. Wood contributed frequently to medical literature, but his reputation as a writer is chiefly based upon his Treatise on Practice, published in 1847, which ran through six editions, the last being in 1867. Previous to this work, however, he had, with the late Dr. Bache, compiled the Dispensatory of the United States, which first appeared in 1833.

They later turned to comedy and, after a successful appearance on a talent show, they had their own television series in 1977, and then appeared on another major network from 1978 until their show ended in 1991. The comic performer was generally the funny man while the straight man was the more serious counterpart. The comic performer did a number of impressions, particularly of cartoon characters, while the straight man simply stood nearby, looking perplexed and distressed. They continued to appear in theatres and pantomimes, including a production written by Ian Billings. The two were at the peak of their popularity, along with another famous duo, in the 1980s. However, as mainstream comedy moved away from their style towards alternative comedy, their popularity dwindled. The comic performer was told that he might have a heart attack at any moment. The partnership split up when the comic performer had to have a heart transplant. The straight man performs on cruise ships, notably during September 2007, and used to run a restaurant at a pub and now runs a restaurant in the oldest pub in his hometown called The Steamer.

Barnard was a member of the team headed by his brother Christiaan Barnard that performed the world's first human-to-human heart transplantation in 1967. Specifically, he was one of the surgeons who removed the heart from donor Denise Darvall at Groote Schuur Hospital. After a 2009 documentary film Hidden Heart suggested that Hamilton Naki removed the donor heart, Barnard was quoted as describing the film as \\\"rubbish, a joke, it’s a total distortion of the facts\\\" and as stating that Naki was at the time \\\"in his bed, about 8 km away from Groote Schuur\\\". Barnard was motivated by the financial hardship he saw his patients suffer after he had treated their critical illnesses to convince the South African insurance companies to introduce a new type of insurance to cover critical illnesses. Barnard argued that, as a medical doctor, he can repair a man physically, but only insurers can repair a patient's finances. On 6 August 1983 the first critical illness insurance policy was launched. Barnard was a member of the South African parliament between 1980 and 1989, for the Progressive Federal Party - one of the few political parties that opposed apartheid. He later acted as a technical consultant for Scottish Widows.

She was also a graduate and educator, a business owner, a chef, and an author. Wakefield was educated at Framingham State Normal School Department of Household Arts in 1924. Then, she worked as a dietitian and lectured about foods. In 1928, she and her husband Kenneth Donald Wakefield (1897–1997) had a son, Kenneth Donald Wakefield Jr. In 1930, she and her husband bought a tourist lodge (the Toll House Inn) in the town of Whitman, Massachusetts in Plymouth County. Located about halfway between Boston and New Bedford, it was a place where passengers had historically paid a toll, changed horses and ate home home-cooked meals. When the Wakefields opened their business, they named the establishment the Toll House Inn. Ruth cooked and served all the food and soon gained local fame for her lobster dinners and desserts. The restaurant had many visitors, including Massachusetts' Senator John F. Kennedy. Her chocolate chip cookies soon became very popular. She invented chocolate chip cookies around 1938. It is often incorrectly reported that the cookie was an accident, and that Wakefield expected the chocolate chunks to melt making chocolate cookies. In reality, Wakefield stated that she deliberately invented the cookie. She said, \\\"We had been serving a thin butterscotch nut cookie with ice cream. Everybody seemed to love it, but I was trying to give them something different.

Soon, hundreds of soldiers were writing home asking their families to send them some Toll House cookies, and Wakefield was soon inundated with letters from around the world requesting her recipe. Thus began the nationwide craze for the chocolate chip cookie. As the popularity of the Toll House Chocolate Crunch Cookie increased, the sales of Nestlé's semi-sweet chocolate bars also spiked. Andrew Nestlé and Ruth Wakefield made a business arrangement: Wakefield gave Nestlé the right to use her cookie recipe and the Toll House name for one dollar and a lifetime supply of Nestlé chocolate.

{"text": "Alexey Borisovich Vyzmanavin (1 January 1960 – 6 January 2000) was a Russian chess Grandmaster. During the early part of his career, he regularly played in the Moscow Championships and in 1981, with an Elo rating of 2200, finished sixth, ahead of several strong grandmasters including David Bronstein, Yuri Razuvaev, Artur Yusupov, Alexey Suetin, Rafael Vaganian and Evgeny Vasiukov. He went on to win the event in 1984 and 1986. Qualifying as a grandmaster in 1989, he went on to tie for first place at the 1990 USSR Championship in Leningrad (the title going to Alexander Beliavsky on tie-break). He placed 5th-9th the following year at the final (58th) Soviet Championship, held in Moscow. These championship successes contributed to his selection for the national team and this included participating at the 1992 Manila Olympiad. Playing reserve board 2, he scored +3 =6 −0, helping the Russian team to the gold medal. Among his international tournament successes were wins at Nałęczów 1986 and Tashkent 1987. He shared first place at Moscow 1988 (with Razuvaev, Gregory Kaidanov and Lev Psakhis) and won at Sochi 1989 (ahead of Joël Lautier and Alexander Khalifman). There followed his victory at the 1990/91 edition of the Rilton Cup in Stockholm and further success at the Gelsenkirchen 1991 tournament, where he won ahead of Vasily Smyslov. He surprised the chess world at Leon in 1993, by placing second behind tournament victor Leonid Yudasin and thereby restricting Anatoly Karpov to a share of third prize (with Veselin Topalov and Peter Leko). As a player of rapid and blitz chess, his reputation was that of a 'speed demon', competing at the PCA rapidplay events of the 1990s and frequently outplaying his more illustrious opponents. At the Moscow event in 1994, he reached the semi-final, narrowly losing out to Vladimir Kramnik, having already beaten Alexei Shirov and Viktor Korchnoi. Commentating at one such PCA event, Maurice Ashley described Vyzmanavin in predatory terms—\\\"He's a dangerous one, the V-man, looking like a cat, ready to pounce.\\\" His highest Elo rating was 2620 and he ceased playing around 1997. Vyzmanavin's early death, aged 40, was officially described as being caused by a heart attack. He lived alone, but had been out with friends in Moscow on 6 January 2000 (the Russian Christmas) and his body was discovered some six days later. There were also reports of poverty and depression.

Field was born in Hackney in 1786, his father was John Field a corn and seed merchant who was later to become Master of the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors. Field was a pupil of dockyard engineer Simon Goodrich from 1803 to 1805. Commissioned by Samuel Bentham, the Inspector-general of naval works, he worked with Samuel Goodrich to develop tools for mass-producing ships' blocks at Portsmouth Dockyard. The block mills they designed required ten unskilled men to take the place of 110 skilled craftsmen, and have been recognised as the first use of machine tools for mass production. They were built by Henry Maudslay between 1802 and 1806, and represented the first steam-powered manufactory in any dockyard. He then joined Maudslay to form the firm of Messrs. Maudslay, Sons and Field of Lambeth. One of their projects was to build engines for the SS Great Western's Atlantic crossing of 1838. He was a prolific engineer working with the Atlantic Telegraph Company on machinery for cable laying, the Metropolitan Board of Works on sewage systems and Isambard Kingdom Brunel on his steamships. Field joined seven other young engineers who, in 1817, decided to found the Institution of Civil Engineers as a more accessible institution than the established but élitist Society of Civil Engineers founded by John Smeaton in 1771. He served as their vice-president in 1837, and he continued to hold that office until elected president on 18 January 1848, being the first mechanical engineer to hold the presidency and the only one of the original proposers to hold the post. In his inaugural address, delivered on 1 February, he alluded particularly to the changes which had then been introduced into steam navigation which allowed for a greater capacity and speeds. On 3 March 1836 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and was also a member of the Society of Arts.

{"text": "Jean-Michel Saive (born 17 November 1969) is a Belgian former professional table tennis player. Born in Liège in a table tennis playing family, Saive began playing as a small boy. His father was the tenth ranking Belgian player and his mother won the Belgian ladies' doubles championships when she was pregnant with him. At the age of thirteen Saive was the fourth ranking Belgian player and joined the national team. In 1985 he was ranked best player in Belgium, a place which he kept until 2011 without interruption. In 1994 he made it to world number one for 515 days (from 9 February 1994 to 8 June 1995 and from 26 March 1996 to 24 April 1996). Jean-Michel Saive won a total of 130 medals (51 gold, 38 silver and 41 bronze) in international singles tournaments. Some of his important titles are: \\n*  A European Championship (1994) in Birmingham (United Kingdom) \\n*  A Europe \\\"Top 12\\\" (1994) in Arezzo (Italy) \\n*  Two European leagues with Belgium (1994 and 1995) \\n*  Six European Championship Club Cups with his Club La Villette Charleroi (1994, 1996, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004) \\n*  Nineteen Belgian Championships with his Club La Villette Charleroi \\n*  A victory at the World Pro Tour in 2001 \\n*  Two victories at the \\\"Qatar Open\\\" (1996 and 2002) He was also individual world vice champion in 1993, finalist at the World Cup in 1994 and 2003 and he was finalist at the world championship for teams with Belgium in 2001. He participated in seven consecutive Summer Olympic Games, from 1988, when table tennis became an official Olympic sport in Seoul, to 2012 in London. At the opening ceremony of the Olympic Games 1996 and 2004 he was the flag bearer of the Belgian team. For the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, the 20 highest ranked ITTF players were to be selected for the Olympics. Saive expected to be selected as he was tied in 20th position together with the Swede Jörgen Persson and there was no rule to decide what to do in case of ties. The ITTF decided they needed to play an extra playoff to determine who got the last spot.However, they refused to play as they agreed they should both get a ticket. The ITTF then recalculated the rankings and placed Persson in 20th position and Saive in 21st. Eventually, Saive did play an extra qualification tournament in Budapest, finishing third and thus qualified for his seventh successive Summer Olympics. Both Saive and Persson, along with Croatian Zoran Primorac, were the first only table tennis players to compete at seven Olympics, having been at all Games since the sport was introduced in 1988. His successes made him the best Belgian table tennis player. He is also considered to be one of Belgium's most prolific athletes as he was elected as Sports Personality of the Year 1991 and 1994. Jean-Michel Saive is known for his victories but also for his sportsmanship. He was awarded the UNESCO World Award of Fair Play in 1989.

Hubrick (1858 - January 22, 1930) was an Alaskan adventurer, hunter, newsman and photographer best known for his panoramic photographs of the Wrangell mountain range through the early 1900s.

The paper lasted for only three issues, however, and as such Hubrick's real legacy is derived from his photographic work. Hubrick's photographic talent is evident in his breathtaking panoramas of the Alaskan countryside. The panoramas can be over six feet long and some are hand-tinted in supreme detail. Some carry scenes from the past. In the Hubrick panorama \\\"Goat Trail,\\\" you can see many goats walking the trail. In the panorama \\\"Taken From Nicolai Hill,\\\" you get a little snapshot of the Hubrick party at a photography shoot. You can see two riding horses, pack animals, and his guide. It is said that most of Mr. Hubrick's photographs were personally sold in or around McCarthy, Alaska circa 1916-1930. The best count (guess) of known existing original photographic prints puts the number around 25. There are also some negatives. Hubrick copies are sold in Alaska for around $45. In addition to art, panoramas like those of J.P. Hubrick have other uses.

He is currently Course Director for BA Fashion Design at the University of Westminster, where he has lectured since 2001. He also works as a creative director, stylist and writer. Groves is remembered for his controversial catwalk shows. In the 1990s, he designed under the label \\\"Jimmy Jumble\\\". The confrontational themes of his collections for London Fashion Week ensured that he caught people's attention and enhanced his notoriety. His first scheduled show, \\\"Ourselves Alone\\\" (translated from the Gaelic \\\"Sinn Féin\\\") referred to The Troubles in Ireland, combining the colours of the rival factions of Irish unionists and Irish republicians. The models wore orange sashes, grey suits, and charred green taffeta, with one model apparently setting herself on fire during the show. Outside the show 30 foot burning crucifixes were erected. Another show, \\\"Cocaine Nights\\\", (named after J.G. Ballard's novel, and also inspired by the film Face/Off ) had the models walking on a catwalk apparently spread with sugar-like cocaine. One dress was made of razor blades. At the time, Bill Clinton, the then President of the USA, had condemned the fashion industry for glamorizing drug use, so this was seen as deliberate provocation. Groves is known for his tailoring, and before he launched his own label, he worked as head assistant to Alexander McQueen for several years. In addition to his runway collections, Groves has created costumes for Robbie Williams, Kylie Minogue, Suede, and The Spice Girls.

{"text": "George Samuel Hunt (22 February 1910 – 19 September 1996) was an English footballer who played at inside or centre forward. Born in Mexborough, Yorkshire, Hunt spent his early career playing for local sides in his native county, having trials with both Barnsley and Sheffield United, both of whom rejected him. He eventually joined Chesterfield in 1929 and in his only season there scored nine times in fourteen games. He moved on from Chesterfield to Tottenham Hotspur in June 1930 and spent seven seasons with the club, and was a prolific goalscorer, hitting 138 goals in 198 matches for Tottenham as they were promoted to the First Division and becoming the club's top scorer for five consecutive seasons, from 1931–32 through to 1935–36. He also won three caps for England during this time, scoring one goal. His scoring form attracted the attention of Spurs' neighbours and rivals Arsenal, who signed him in 1937, making him the first player to move directly from Spurs to Arsenal since the latter club's move to Highbury in 1913. Intended as a replacement for Ted Drake (who was injured at the time), Hunt made his debut against Manchester City on 2 October 1937 at Highbury, having coincidentally played there for Spurs in a reserve match three days earlier, on 29 September. In 1937–38, Hunt played 21 matches (18 in the league) for Arsenal and earned a First Division winners' medal; however, he only scored three goals and was sold to Bolton Wanderers in the summer of 1938 after Drake's recovery, and to make way for the subsequent signing of Bryn Jones. At Bolton, Hunt returned to form and hit 23 goals in the 1938–39 season. After that his career was interrupted by the Second World War, although he still played wartime matches for Bolton. He finished his career with a one-year stint at Sheffield Wednesday between 1946 and 1948. After retiring from playing, he returned to Bolton as a coach and trainer in 1948, and was a member of the club's backroom staff when they won the 1957–58 FA Cup.

Early in his life Stevens worked as a coffee house manager in New York City and took publicity photos of musicians playing the Playhouse Cafe. He was encouraged to pursue photography as a career by rock photographer Jim Marshall. Stevens did not have any formal training in photography and served for a time as the road manager for The Lovin' Spoonful. He realized he \\\"had an eye\\\" for photography. Some of Stevens' photos have been considered iconic. One is of Paul McCartney trying to hide in the arms of his wife Linda during the couple's arrest for marijuana possession on Aug. 10, 1972 after a Wings concert in Gothenburg, Sweden. Stevens was Wings' official tour photographer. In January 1978 Stevens photographed the Sex Pistols on their only American tour. When the group broke up in San Francisco, Stevens helped lead singer Johnny Rotten (John Lydon) fly to New York City, where Rotten stayed in the photographer's New York apartment before returning to London.

After a long minor league career in the Pacific Coast and Western leagues – and after missing three full seasons (1927–29) in his prime due to arm trouble – Brucker was an unusually old rookie player in the Major Leagues. He made his debut on April 19, 1937, not quite three weeks shy of his 36th birthday. Born in Albany, New York, Brucker threw and batted right-handed, stood 5 ft 11 in (1.80 m) (180 cm) tall and weighed 175 pounds (79 kg). He made his first appearance in professional baseball in 1924 for the Seattle Indians of the Pacific Coast League, but it would be 13 years before he would reach the majors. He was even a playing manager in the Western League during this apprenticeship. He played his entire MLB career (1937–40; 1943) for the Philadelphia Athletics and served as a coach under legendary A's manager Connie Mack for nine full seasons, 1941–49. In 241 total games, he batted .290 in 707 at bats, with 12 home runs and 105 runs batted in. In 1938, his best campaign, Brucker batted .374 with 64 hits in 171 at bats, three homers and 35 RBI. During his long tenure with Philadelphia, he also witnessed the brief major-league career of his son Earle Brucker Jr., also a catcher, who appeared in two games for the Athletics at the end of the 1948 season. After leaving the A's, Brucker Sr. coached for the St. Louis Browns (1950) and the Cincinnati Reds (1952). During the latter season, from July 30 to August 3, he served as interim manager of the Reds for five games during the transition between Luke Sewell and Rogers Hornsby as Cincinnati's permanent manager. His sixth-place Reds won three of five during his brief tenure. Following that season, Brucker managed in the Reds' farm system for two additional campaigns before leaving the game.

As a climber, his first contribution appears to have been, in 1899, the route now called 'Andrews' renne' on Storen, Norway. He is especially remembered for two later climbing contributions: for his co-authorship, with J. M. A. Thomson in 1909 of the first rock-climbing guide-book, to the cliffs of Lliwedd, in Snowdonia; and for being the 'father' of Cornish sea cliff climbing, beginning with an early ascent (1902) of the Bosigran Ridge Climb (aka Commando Ridge grid reference SW413368) followed by Ledge Climb (also Bosigran) in 1905. With E. C. Pyatt he later produced the first official (Climbers' Club) Cornish climbing guide, in 1950. He is also believed (ref 1) to have had a project to traverse all the British coastline, between the high and low water marks, aided where necessary by a rope, starting in Cornwall.

{"text": "Steven Clark Ellsworth (born July 30, 1960 in Chicago) is the son of Dick Ellsworth and is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who played for the Boston Red Sox in 1988. Towering over most of his teammates at 6'8\\\" tall (and 220 pounds), this right-hander attended Bullard High School in Fresno, California. He then went on to attend Cal State Northridge and Fresno City College. He was drafted twice in 1980, once by the Minnesota Twins in the seventh round and once by the Cleveland Indians in the third round. He didn't sign either time. He was drafted by the Red Sox in the first round of the 1981 draft, 9th overall. This time, he did sign. His professional career started that year, though he appeared in only one professional game, with the low-A Elmira Pioneers of the New York–Penn League. In that one game, he gave up two runs in one inning pitched, while walking two and striking out zero. Between 1981 and 1988, he was used both as a starter and a reliever in the minors. In 1983 with the Winston-Salem Red Sox, he went 13-8 with a 3.29 ERA in 164+ innings as a starter. In 1986 with the Pawtucket Red Sox, he went 6-2 with a 3.36 ERA in 83 innings of work as a reliever. On April 7, 1988 at the age of 27, he made his Major League debut. He pitched two innings that game, giving up 8 hits and 5 earned runs. He struck out two, but still earned a loss. The rest of his career didn't fare him too well either – overall, he went 1 and 6 with a 6.75 ERA in 36 innings. He gave up seven home runs, walked 16 and struck out 16. He also hit one batter and threw one wild pitch. Perhaps the best start of his career was his second: On April 16, 1988, he gave up only one run while striking out five in seven innings against the Texas Rangers. Even though he pitched well that game, he still got the loss. His only win came on April 21 against the Detroit Tigers. In the field, he made no errors for a fielding percentage of 1.000.

{"text": "Vladimir Pavlovich Malaniuk (Malanyuk) (born July 21, 1957, Arkhangelsk, Soviet Union) is a Ukrainian chess Grandmaster. Considered by many to be one of the more colourful characters on the chess circuit, he has an extraordinary talent for rapid chess, which has been demonstrated at some of the world's most prestigious 'speed chess' tournaments. In 2005, he finished second at the Tallinn (Keres Memorial) rapid event, behind Alexey Shirov but ahead of such luminaries as Anatoly Karpov and Boris Gelfand. The same year, he took the silver medal at the European Rapid Championship, behind the strong Hungarian Grandmaster (GM) Zoltan Gyimesi. His sustained efforts were again rewarded in 2006, when at the Ajaccio Open Rapid event, he finished clear winner, ahead of a large group of strong GMs and Super-GMs including Kasimdzhanov, Milov, Bareev, Motylev, Bologan, Almasi, Smirin, Sokolov, Naiditsch, Sasikiran and Van Wely. Whilst it is rare that older players can achieve this kind of success against more youthful talents, it is not completely unknown. Yuri Balashov is another mature player who enjoys success in such events and it is probable that good quality rapid chess relies as much on intuition as calculation and stamina, giving the experienced professional good chances against younger, sharper, but less knowledgeable minds. Malaniuk has also been a strong player at standard time limits, winning many national and international tournaments, including Minsk 1985, Kostroma 1985 (USSR Ch. Semi-final), Lvov 1986 and Frunze 1987 on the road to securing his Grandmaster title (awarded in 1987). There were further victories recorded at Forlì in 1990 and 1992, Porto San Giorgio 1994, Minsk 1997 Krasnodar 2001, Arkhangelsk 2002, Krasnodar 2002, Koszalin 2002, Kolobrzeg 2003, Kraków 2003 and Mielno 2006. Notable runner-up performances include Baku 1983, Tallinn 1987, Lvov 1988, Świdnica 2001 and Kraków 2004. He was a regular participant of the Soviet Championships between 1983 and 1991; his best finish occurring in 1986, when he shared second place behind Vitaly Tseshkovsky. In Ukraine, he has thus far been the national champion on three occasions, in 1980, 1981 and 1986. In team chess, he played for Ukraine in the Moscow 1994, Yerevan 1996 and Elista 1998 Chess Olympiads, winning team silver and bronze medals in '96 and '98, respectively. Malaniuk has been credited with an important contribution to chess opening theory. Along with Sergey Dolmatov, Mikhail Gurevich and Evgeny Bareev, his faithful adherence to the Leningrad Dutch Defence (described as a hybrid of the Dutch and the King's Indian) helped shape a dynamic new approach to the system in the 1980s and this led to a dramatic resurgence of interest.

Many of the photographs can be seen on \\\"A Day with BA\\\", the online chronicle. Andrews grew up surfing in La Jolla, California. He caught his first wave in 1957 at La Jolla Shores Beach. By the early sixties, he had joined the line-up at Windansea Beach, and with other local surfers, he helped establish Black's Beach as a world class break. The Surfer's Journal has called Andrews the “first Black’s local”, a considerable accomplishment given the difficult trail or long paddle to access Black's Beach. In 1965 Andrews’ reputation landed him on the cover of Surfer magazine. The cover photograph shows Andrews on a wave at Black's. With time, Andrews' long-lived and vocal presence, in and out of the water, has made him something of a surf sage.

It was Josephine Baker who encouraged Belew to work as a costume designer. While he made costumes for plays, musicals, operas, ballets, TV specials and TV series, Belew is particularly famous for the stage outfits he made for Elvis. He created the tight-fitting black leather outfit that Elvis wore in the 1968 NBC Comeback Special, and the bell-bottomed jumpsuit outfits with high Napoleonic collars, pointed sleeve cuffs, wide belts and capes, decorated with gems, metal and rhinestone studding, sequins and embroidery. Belew also designed the suit Elvis is wearing on the famous photo of President Nixon and him in the Oval Office, a velveteen outfit originally designed for Elvis to use in his Las Vegas shows. Of the collars, Belew has explained that they were inspired by Napoleon's wardrobe and that he chose them because they would frame and draw attention to Presley's face. In an interview Belew explained why most of the jumpsuits were white: The lighting [in Las Vegas] was still in its early stages. And we found that the color that worked the best was white. It allowed them to change the colors on him, where as black would absorb all the color. And it was hard to highlight him. And we experimented with blue which was one of his favorite colors. Red. But it just ended up that white was the best thing and, of course, you know, you want the star to be the person, you know, and not the wardrobe. During the 1970s Belew designed Elvis' offstage wardrobe, as well. Among the most famous of Belew's Elvis jumpsuits are the American Eagle (created for the 1973 Elvis: Aloha from Hawaii via Satellite) and the Peacock (first worn at the Forum in Los Angeles in 1974, and later seen on the cover to the 1975 album Promised Land). In 2008 the Peacock suit was sold at an online auction for $300,000. This made it the most expensive piece of Elvis memorabilia sold at auction. The elaborate embroidery, which was getting a more prominent role on the jumpsuits in 1974–1977, was the work of Gene Doucette. In the 1970's, Bill Belew was in big demand. He was busy doing television shows and movies, so he would give Gene the blank suits and Gene would design them himself. Gene designed most of the suits from 1972 until Elvis' death.

He is Scotland's second player to be awarded the title of Grandmaster (GM), fulfilling its requirements in 1992 just after Paul Motwani.

{"text": "Chu Guiting (26 July 1892 – 16 February 1977) was a prolific martial artist who studied under the famous local masters, Jiang Yuhe, Yu Bingzhong, and Chen Delu, and went on to influence many different Chinese martial arts schools through his teaching. In 1912, Chu Guiting began to study Xingyiquan (Shape and Mind Boxing) and Baguazhang (Eight Trigram Boxing) under Grandmaster Li Cunyi, who recognized him as his official disciple. At the age of twenty, Chu Guiting left his hometown and traveled extensively throughout China, visiting Beijing and Tianjin, Liaoning in the north, and Wuhan, Changsha, and Nanchang in the south. In 1921, Chu Guiting studied Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) in Hangzhou under Yang Chengfu – a direct descendent of the style's progenitor, Yang Lu-ch'an. In doing so, he became one of the \\\"Five Tiger Generals\\\". Between 1916 and 1940, Chu Guiting was heavily involved in martial arts in both Jiangsu and Shanghai. During this time he worked with the East China Five Province General's Bodyguards, the Central Chinese Boxing Association, the Zhejiang Province Chinese Boxing Association, the Central Police Officers Association, the Presidential Palace Bodyguards, the National Government's Military Department, and the Jiangsu Public Security Headquarters. He also taught Chinese martial arts privately. In 1928, General Li, General Zhang Zi Jiang, and General Fung Zu Ziang held the first full-contact national competition in Nanjing, China. The purpose was to find the best candidates for teaching positions at the government-sponsored Central Martial Arts Academy. Hundreds of the best Chinese martial artists participated in sanda, weapons, and shuai jiao. After several days, the fighting competitions were halted because too many competitors were seriously injured. Two died. Since the fights were stopped prematurely, 12 martial artists have historically been remembered as \\\"the champion\\\". Chu Guiting was one of them. During the 1950s, Chu Guiting settled in Shanghai and began to teach classes in Waitan Park, Fuxing Park, and the Peoples’ Park. He also taught classes for a wide range of companies including the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, the Government's Public Security Department, the Shanghai Electric Cable Factory, the Poplar Tree Beach Power Plant, and the Eternal Peace Company. In 1958, Chu Guiting was invited to become the Chinese National Martial Arts Committee's Assistant Director. Following this, he was invited with Wang Ziping and Lu Zhenduo to choreograph a sword dance for the Shanghai Song and Dance Institution, which won a silver medal at the World Youth Festival. In 1956, Chu Guiting, Cai Longyun, Fu Zhongwen, and Zhang Yu were commissioned by the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Education Union to condense and simplify Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist) into a general system that could be conveniently studied by the masses. Shortly afterwards, Chu Guiting, Gu Liuxin, and Fu Zhongwen were invited to Beijing to formulate the famous Simplified 24 and 28 Step Yang-shi taijiquan (Yang Style Grand Ultimate Fist), forms that are still practiced throughout China today. Chu Guiting was a renowned teacher. It was his belief that in order to learn martial arts one must harmonize the body, the breath, and the mind. Many Chinese martial artists trace their lineage back to Chu Guiting, and he taught artists from other styles. For example, he taught Xingyiquan, Baguazhang, and Taijiquan to Chan Yik Yan. In teaching, Chu Guiting paid particular attention to the moral philosophy of Chinese martial arts, and would often say: \\\"With morals much can be achieved, without them nothing can be achieved. Consider, for example, somebody who studies a martial art but does not recognize its moral and philosophical depth. They will soon give it up because they have only ever tasted the skin of the grape and not the fruit that it contains.\\\" Chu Guiting died on 16 February 1977.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Athlete", "l3": "MartialArtist", "wiki_name": "Chu_Guiting", "word_count": 634, "label": "Martial Artist", "people": "Chu Guiting", "personality": {"birth_year": 1892, "sex": "male", "birth_city_country": null, "education_level": null, "occupation": "martial artist", "income_level": null}, "anonymized_response": "A skilled practitioner of movement arts studied under several respected instructors and went on to influence many different movement disciplines through teaching.

He changed employer again in 1884 when he went to work for the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway (LYR) before becoming the Chief Engineer of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS&LR) in 1890. During his time at MS&LR he was responsible for the design of many of the works involved with that company's London Extension. In 1896 Ross became the Chief Engineer of the Great Northern Railway (GNR), a post he held until 1911 when he became an engineering consultant. During his time at GNR his advice was sought by the company's board on the locomotive design to be chosen for their no.1300 series of engines. Several designs were rejected as they were judged to be too long or heavy for the rail infrastructure. Despite several attempts at redesign by Nigel Gresley the series was scrapped in 1924. His works as an engineering consultant included the Hertford Loop Line and Breydon Viaduct, with Ross serving as the Engineer-in-Chief of the latter. On 16 June 1897 he was appointed Major in the Engineer and Railway Staff Corps, an unpaid unit of the Volunteer Force which provided technical advice to the British Army. He was a Lieutenant-Colonel in that corps at the time it joined the Territorial Force on 1 April 1908. He had been a member of the Institution of Civil Engineers since before 16 June 1897 and from November 1915 to November 1916 he served as their president.

After leaving Ireland Simms became an astronomical assistant at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, under John Pond. He resigned his post on 31 October 1835, apparently having hoped to be awarded the post of First Assistant, for which he was \\\"quite incompetent\\\" in the words of Sir George Biddell Airy. He returned to his former occupation as a surveyor and civil engineer, visiting France with Richard Tappin Claridge, who in the 1830s patented the use of Seyssel asphalt in the UK, and later working with Claridge on the introduction of asphalt to Britain. The formation in 1838 of Claridge's Patent Asphalte Company (which ceased operating in 1917 ) \\\"gave an enormous impetus to the development of a British asphalt industry\\\". Simms' own efforts included writing a pamphlet promoting the use of Seyssel asphalt, based on an 1836 paper by geologist M. Rozet. In 1836 Simms joined the South Eastern Railway Company as a resident engineer and undertook a considerable number of works, including the construction of the Bletchingley and Saltwood tunnels. In 1846 the East India Company, having decided to construct railways in their territories, proposed to Simms that he become their consulting engineer in India. His health suffered from the climate and he spend some time in Mauritius before returning to duty where, among other work, he supervised a complete survey and mapping of the city of Calcutta which was principally carried out by local assistants.
