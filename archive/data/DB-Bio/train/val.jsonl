In the European touring car class of the event he led at one juncture with a total time of 8 hours,29 minutes, and 24 seconds.

In one memorable incident, after being accused by a viewer of not having invented the \\\"filled strawberry\\\" himself, Wilmenrod put a long cook's knife against his chest and swore to kill himself if a single viewer who had previously eaten filled strawberry were to call.

He is a member of the National Soccer Hall of Fame. When Zerhusen was five, his family moved from New York to Germany where he learned to play soccer. He moved back to the U.S. in 1950 and settled in Cincinnati, Ohio. However, he was soon after drafted into the Army. After a period stationed in Germany, Zerhusen was transferred back to a base in Cincinnati. In 1954, he played for the Armed Forces soccer team in Cincinnati. At the time soccer was not a truly professional sport in the U.S. so when Zerhusen left the Army, he remained an amateur with the Cincinnati Kolping Soccer Club. In 1956, he was selected for the U.S. team which competed in the 1956 Summer Olympics. The Olympic tournament in 1956 was single game elimination and the U.S. lost 9-1 to Yugoslavia in the first game, Zerhusen scoring for the U.S. However, in preparation for the games, the U.S. had played several exhibition matches and Zerhusen scored seventeen goals in nine games leading up to the Olympics.

{"text": "Eugene de Salignac (1861–1943) was an American photographer who worked for the Department of Bridges/Plant and Structures in New York City. Born in Boston in 1861 into an eccentric family of exiled French nobility, de Salignac had no formal training in photography. In 1903, at the age of 42, his brother-in-law found him a job as an assistant to the photographer for the Department of Bridges, Joseph Palmer. After 3 years of apprenticeship, Palmer suddenly died, and in October 1906, de Salignac assumed his duties. As the sole photographer for the department from 1906 to 1934 (in 1916 it changed its name to the Department of Plant & Structures), he documented the creation of the city's modern infrastructure—including bridges, major municipal buildings, roads and subways. Most notably, he documented the construction of the Manhattan Bridge and the Queensboro Bridge, and the Manhattan Municipal Building but his most famous image is that of painters posing nonchalantly on the cables of the Brooklyn Bridge. Using a large-format camera and 8x10 inch glass-plate negatives, he shot over 20,000 images in his career. Most of these negatives and over 15,000 vintage prints are held by the New York City Municipal Archives. Into his 70s de Salignac was still climbing bridges and actively working, but he was forced to retire in 1934 despite a petition to Mayor La Guardia.

{"text": "Peter Alfred Penfold, CMG, OBE, (born 27 February 1944) is a retired British diplomat. His career began in 1963, when he joined the Foreign Service as a clerical officer. Two years into his career, he was posted to the British embassy in Bonn, West Germany, and two years after that to Nigeria. From 1970 to 1972, Penfold served as a \\\"floater\\\" in Latin America, filling in as necessary for staff at British missions in the region. He served in Mexico during the 1970 football world cup, and on St Vincent, where he was responsible for organising an evacuation after a volcanic eruption. After Latin America, Penfold briefly served in Canberra, before returning to London to take a post in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO). He earned early promotion to second secretary in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, where he was responsible for reporting on the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the Eritrean War of Independence and was still in the country during the revolution, in which the pro-Western emperor was overthrown. After completing his tour in Ethiopia, Penfold served as information officer in Port of Spain and then as first secretary in the West Africa Department of the FCO. Penfold's next overseas posting was to Kampala, Uganda, as deputy high commissioner. There, he persuaded President Milton Obote to attend the queen's birthday party for the first time. Two months later, Obote was overthrown in a coup, after which Penfold led an evacuation of foreign citizens to Kenya. The high commission remained open, and Penfold was still present six months later when a second coup took place. In 1987, he again returned to the FCO, this time serving in the West Indian and Atlantic Department, and four years later, he was appointed Governor of the British Virgin Islands. The main issues of Penfold's tenure were the establishment of the territory as an offshore financial centre and the smuggling of drugs through its waters until the sudden death of the chief minister. Penfold resolved the subsequent constitutional crisis by appointing the deputy chief minister as an interim replacement. Penfold's term as governor expired in 1996, after which he spent a year as a drugs adviser to the Caribbean before being appointed High Commissioner to Sierra Leone in 1997. Six weeks into Penfold's term, President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah was overthrown in a military coup and Penfold organised an evacuation of foreign citizens. After a hotel housing the remaining foreign nationals was attacked, Penfold organised a further evacuation, which was conducted by an American warship. The ship transported the evacuees—including Penfold—to Conakry in neighbouring Guinea. While in Conakry, Penfold advised Kabbah on re-establishing his government in exile, and leased a disused restaurant for the government's headquarters. Kabbah was restored in February 1998, but the role of the private military company Sandline International in assisting Kabbah created controversy in the United Kingdom, as its services were alleged to violate an arms embargo on Sierra Leone. After an HM Customs investigation, a parliamentary inquiry, and a select committee investigation, Penfold was reprimanded but allowed to return to his post. Later in the year, violence began to intensify again in Sierra Leone, and Penfold was ordered to evacuate foreign nationals (the eight evacuation of his career and the second in Sierra Leone) over Christmas 1998. He requested an extension to his term as high commissioner, but the request was denied and he left Sierra Leone in April 2000. He spent the last year of his career working for the Department for International Development and retired in 2001. In retirement, Penfold has spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly Sierra Leone, and has been critical of the FCO.

There, they successfully encouraged the head of state to attend a national day celebration for the first time. Shortly after, a coup occurred, and this person led an evacuation of foreign citizens to a neighboring country. The diplomatic mission remained open, and they were still present when a second coup took place some time later. In a later period, they returned to the foreign office, serving in a department handling Caribbean and Atlantic affairs. Some years later, they were appointed to an administrative role in a British overseas territory. Key issues during their tenure included developing the territory as a financial center and addressing drug trafficking through its waters, until the unexpected death of a senior local official. They resolved the subsequent constitutional issue by appointing an interim replacement.\n\nTheir term in this role concluded after some years, after which they spent time as an adviser on regional drug issues before being appointed as a senior representative to a West African nation. Shortly after their appointment, the president was overthrown in a military coup, and they organized an evacuation of foreign citizens. After an attack on a hotel housing remaining foreign nationals, they coordinated a further evacuation, which was carried out by a foreign naval vessel. The ship transported the evacuees—including this person—to a neighboring country. While there, they advised the deposed president on re-establishing a government in exile and secured a location for its headquarters.\n\nThe president was restored to power some time later, but controversy arose in this person's home country over the involvement of a private military company in assisting the president, due to allegations of violating an arms embargo. Following an investigation by authorities and an inquiry, this person was reprimanded but permitted to return to their post. Later that year, violence escalated again in the country, and they were ordered to evacuate foreign nationals over the holiday period—marking another evacuation of their career and the second in that country. They requested an extension to their term as senior representative, but the request was denied and they left the country some time later. They spent the final year of their career working for an international development department and retired in the early 2000s.\n\nIn retirement, they have spoken on issues concerning Africa, particularly the West African nation where they served, and have been critical of the foreign office. Their support for the president and role in their return to power earned them a popular status in that country.", "anonymization_meta": {"status": "max_iterations_reached", "iterations_used": 5, "final_leaked_attributes": ["occupation", "income_level"], "final_attacker_guesses": {"name": null, "birth_year": null, "sex": "unknown", "birth_city_country": null, "education_level": "Bachelor's in International Relations", "occupation": "diplomat", "income_level": "high"}}, "loss_description_sentence": "Error: API call failed with exception: Connection error."}

Since then he has driven for AF Corse in their Ferrari 458 GTE at various sportscar events, becoming twice a Le Mans 24 Hour class winner, and a GT class winner of the Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta. He was also Ferrari's F1 reserve driver for 2010. Fisichella won three races in his Formula One career, the first of which was at the chaotic 2003 Brazilian Grand Prix, a race abandoned for safety reasons with 15 laps remaining. After several days of confusion regarding rules and technicalities, Fisichella was eventually declared the winner in the following week, and collected his trophy in an unofficial ceremony at the following race. He was brought into the Renault team to replace fellow Italian Jarno Trulli, and won his first race with the team in Australia in 2005. However, after that race it was his team-mate, the Spanish driver Fernando Alonso, that would win the greater share of races for Renault. Although highly rated as a driver, Fisichella was unable to keep pace with eventual champion Alonso, managing just one further race win following his debut. Outside of driving, he has backed his own GP2 team, FMS International. Fisichella has three children, Carlotta, Christopher and Carolina, with his wife Luna Castellani. The couple married on 10 October 2009. On 17 June 2012 Fisichella won the GTE Pro division of the Le Mans 24hrs for AF Corse and followed this up with the Manufacturers' title in the WEC at the end of the season.

{"text": "Joseph Salim Peress (1896 – June 4, 1978), was a pioneering British diving engineer, inventor of one of the first truly usable atmospheric diving suits, the Tritonia, and was involved in the construction of the famous JIM suit. Salim Peress grew up in the Middle East. It is said that his interest in diving suit design started from the observations of the Persian Gulf pearl divers. Peress had a natural talent for engineering design, and had challenged himself to construct an articulated atmospheric diving suit (ADS) that would keep divers dry and at atmospheric pressure, even at great depth. At the time, little was known about decompression diving. Various atmospheric suits had been developed during the Victorian era, but nobody had yet managed to overcome the basic design problem of constructing a joint which would remain flexible and watertight at depth without seizing up under pressure. In 1918 Peress began working for WG Tarrant at Byfleet, United Kingdom, where he was given the space and tools to develop his ideas about constructing an ADS. His first attempt was an immensely complex prototype machined from solid stainless steel. In 1923 Peress was asked to design a suit for salvage work on the wreck of the P&O liner SS Egypt which had sunk in 122 m (400 ft) of water off Ushant. He declined, on the grounds that his prototype suit was too heavy for a diver to handle easily, but was encouraged by the request to begin work on a new suit using lighter materials. By 1929 he believed he had solved the weight problem, by using cast magnesium instead of steel, and had also managed to improve the design of the suit's joints by using a trapped cushion of oil to keep the surfaces moving smoothly.The oil, which was virtually non-compressible and readily displaceable, allowed the limb joints to move freely at depths of 600 ft (180 m), where the pressure was 520 psi (35 atm). Peress claimed that the Tritonia suit's joints could function at 1,200 ft (370 m) although this was never proven. In 1930 Peress revealed the Tritonia suit. By May it had completed trials and was publicly demonstrated in a tank at Byfleet. In September Peress' assistant Jim Jarret dived in the suit to a depth of 123 m (404 ft) in Loch Ness. The suit performed perfectly, the joints proving resistant to pressure and moving freely even at depth. The suit was offered to the Royal Navy which turned it down, stating that Navy divers never needed to descend below 90 m (300 ft). Jim Jarret made a deep dive to 305 m (1,001 ft) on the wreck of the RMS Lusitania off south Ireland, followed by a shallower dive to 60 metres (200 ft) in the English Channel in 1937 after which, due to lack of interest, the Tritonia suit was retired. Peress abandoned work on diving suits and instead turned to pioneering work in plastic moulding, later forming a company which became the world's largest manufacturer of gas turbine blades for the aircraft industry. In 1965, Peress came back from retirement, starting his collaboration with two British engineers, Mike Humphrey and Mike Borrow, interested in designing a modern atmospheric diving suit. The first order of business was finding the original Tritonia suit, which turned up in a Glasgow warehouse. After all these years, the old suit was still in working conditions, and the octogenarian Peress became the first person to test it in a factory test tank. In 1969 Peress became a consultant to UMEL (Underwater Marine Equipment Limited), the new company formed by Humphrey and Borrow, which eventually created the JIM suit, which was named after Peress' diver Jim Jarret.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "Engineer", "wiki_name": "Joseph_Salim_Peress", "word_count": 618, "label": "Engineer", "people": "Joseph Salim Peress", "personality": {"birth_year": 1896, "sex": "male", "birth_city_country": "Middle East", "education_level": null, "occupation": "diving engineer", "income_level": "middle"}, "anonymized_text": "This individual was a pioneering engineer in diving technology, known for inventing an early usable atmospheric diving suit and for involvement in constructing a later famous model.

{"text": "He studied medicine at the University of Bern, and in 1876 was a general practitioner of medicine in Bern. He was interested in psychosomatic medicine, eventually gaining a reputation as a highly regarded psychotherapist. In 1902 he became a professor of neuropathology at Bern. Dubois was influenced by the writings of German psychiatrist Johann Christian August Heinroth (1773–1843). Dubois is known for the introduction of \\\"persuasion therapy\\\", a process that employed a rational approach for treatment of neurotic disorders. Within this discipline, he developed a psychotherapeutic methodology that was a form of Socratic dialogue, using the doctor-patient relationship as a means to persuade the patient to change his/her behavior. He believed it was necessary to appeal to a patient's intellect and reason in order to eliminate negative and self-destructive habits. He also maintained it was necessary for the physician to convince the patient of the irrationality of his/her neurotic feelings and thought processes. Dubois was disdainful of hypnotic therapy. Dubois has been described as \\\"the first significant modern proponent\\\" of a rational therapy or cognitive therapy, and for some time in the early 20th century it had competed in popularity with Freudian psychoanalysis, especially in the USA, but is little known today. His best known written work was the 1904 Les psychonévroses et leur traitement moral, being later translated into English as \\\"Psychic Treatment of Nervous Disorders (The Psychoneuroses and Their Moral Treatment)\\\".

Hayes was born in Marshall, Michigan. He attended the common schools and graduated from the University of Michigan Law School in Ann Arbor in 1863, and was admitted to the bar the same year. Hayes commenced practice in Marshall and in 1864 and 1865 held the positions of Marshall city attorney and United States commissioner for the eastern district of Michigan. Hayes relocating to Iowa as the Civil War came to an end. He served as United States commissioner for Iowa from 1865 to 1875 and was city solicitor of Clinton, Iowa, in 1870. Hayes was the district judge of the seventh judicial district of Iowa from 1875 to 1887. In that capacity, in 1882 he presided over one of the most important cases in the state of that era, in which liquor merchants challenged the enforceability of the 1882 amendment to the Iowa Constitution requiring prohibition. Hayes declared the amendment unconstitutional on procedural grounds, based on the failure of the law to pass both houses of the Iowa General Assembly in identical form. The Iowa Supreme Court affirmed Hayes' ruling, but in the next session the Iowa General Assembly adopted prohibition, by statute, in a constitutional fashion. Hayes served as delegate to the 1884 Democratic National Convention. In 1886, Hayes wrested the Democratic nomination for the 2nd district away from incumbent Jeremiah Henry Murphy. To enhance the chances for Iowa Republicans to hold all other Congressional seats in Iowa, the state's General Assembly had included many of the most Democratic-leaning areas of eastern Iowa in a single district (the second). Hayes won the general election that year and represented the 2nd district in the 50th United States Congress. He was also elected to the three succeeding Congresses. However, in 1894, when seeking a fifth term, Hayes was defeated in the general election by Republican George M. Curtis. Between the Civil War and the Great Depression, Hayes was the only Democratic congressman from Iowa to serve more than two terms, and (along with Murphy) was one of only two who served two full terms. While in Congress, Hayes served as chairman of the Committee on Education in the Fifty-second Congress. In all, he served in Congress from March 4, 1887, to March 3, 1895. After leaving Congress, Hayes resumed the practice of law in Clinton.He served as member of the Iowa House of Representatives in 1897 and 1898. He died in Marshall, Michigan, on March 14, 1901.

Fuller was born in Bath, Somerset (England), where he trained as an architect. Living in Bath and London he did a number of projects. In 1845 he left for Antigua, where he spent two years working on a new cathedral before emigrating to Canada in 1857. Settling in Toronto, he formed a partnership with Chilion Jones with Fuller responsible for design work. The company first won the contract to design the church of St. Stephen-in-the-Fields. In 1859, The Legislative Assembly in Ottawa voted the sum of £75,000 for the erection of a \\\"Parliament House\\\" and offered a premium of $1000 for the best design within that budget. The winning bid was made by Fuller and Jones for a neo-gothic design. The principal architects until its completion in 1866 were Thomas Fuller and Charles Baillairge.

Taylor hired Luro to run his Windfields Farm, a large breeding and racing operation with two farms in Ontario and another in Chesapeake City, Maryland. In a career that spanned 48 years from 1937 to 1984, Luro trained 43 Stakes winners and 3 Champions. He won the 1962 Kentucky Derby with California-bred Decidedly and two years later won both the Derby and the Preakness Stakes with Northern Dancer, a horse who went on to be the 20th century's greatest sire.

In December 1995, at the age of ten, he approached McLaren team principal Ron Dennis at the Autosport Awards ceremony and told him, \\\"I want to race for you one day ... I want to race for McLaren.\\\" Less than three years later McLaren and Mercedes-Benz signed him to their Young Driver Support Programme. After winning the British Formula Renault, Formula Three Euroseries, and GP2 championships on his way up the racing career ladder, he drove for McLaren in 2007, making his Formula One debut 12 years after his initial encounter with Dennis.

He took up motor sport early in life after his father built him a small car to aid his mobility. His first competitive race was in 1951, in his own MG roadster, bought using a small legacy. As his reputation grew, his name became closely linked with that of Brian Lister, initially driving Lister's Tojeiro special, and later in sports racing cars built by Lister himself, and bearing his name. Archie enjoyed much success driving Lister-Jaguars – the famous Knobblys. Known for his courageous driving style, he was often to be seen in corners getting his Lister very sideways indeed. Asked about the possibility of the Lister's notoriously poor brakes failing completely, he responded that he would \\\"carry on without them, old boy\\\". Over the few years he was in the sport he developed a fierce but good-natured rivalry with rising American driving talent Masten Gregory. He was mortally injured on 18 May 1958 during an accident in a sports car race at Spa-Francorchamps, driving a Lister Knobbly and duelling for the lead with Gregory. Battling hard with Mastern Gregory driving the Ecurie Ecosse Lister Jaguar, they swapped the lead between them inches apart.The competition was so fierce that Archie dented his car's nose on the rear of the Ecosse car on lap three.With Archie leading on lap six they arrived at Blanchimont, then in the Clubhouse bend (where Richard Seaman died in 1939) to find the track slick with rain, the right hand front wheel of the Lister hit a road sign snapping the track rod causing a disastrous accident. He died in hospital (Heusy) the following day, less than a week after his 31st birthday.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "RacingDriver", "l3": "FormulaOneRacer", "wiki_name": "Archie_Scott_Brown", "word_count": 439, "label": "Formula One Racer", "people": "Archie Scott Brown", "personality": {"birth_year": 1927, "sex": "male", "birth_city_country": "Scotland, United Kingdom", "education_level": null, "occupation": "racing driver", "income_level": "high"}, "anonymized_text": "This individual competed in motorsports at an international level, including participation in a premier open-wheel racing series.

Another of Gude's student during this period was de:Georg Müller vom Siel (1865–1939). In 1905 he married his student, Else Schwager, and was appointed professor a year later. From 1908 he lived in Hamburg, later becoming a member of the Hamburg Artists Association. In 1904 he and his wife were founder members of the Oldenburg Art Society. Müller-Kaempff was a successful landscape artist. He produced watercolours, pastels and drawings as well as furniture designs and a multitude of postcards. He was also an accomplished lithographer and produced bird illustrations for the revised edition of Naumann's \\\"Naturgeschichte der Vögel Mitteleuropas\\\".

He controls the running game as well, with a good move to both first base and second, and a quick delivery to the plate.

At first, he worked as a notary clerk, then he started cooking, working at his father's and uncle's restaurant. He studied cooking for a year in Vienna and, on his return to Greece worked for various embassies. He became initially known with the magazine Cooking Guide (Odigos Mageirikis) that he began publishing in 1910, which included – in addition to recipes – nutritional advice, international cuisine, cooking news, etc. In 1919, he became manager of hotel \\\"Hermes\\\", while the next year he left for America, where he worked in some of the more expensive restaurants of the world, while also following higher studies in cooking, confectionery and dietetics. In 1920, he published the influential cookbook, Cooking and Patisserie Guide. He returned to Greece in 1932, founded a small cooking and confectionery school and brought out his well known book of recipes, which, being the first complete cookbook in Greek, had over fifteen official reprints during the following decades. In 1950, he published his only book in English, Greek Cookery. Influenced by French cuisine, he had been the moderniser of Greek cuisine, as, thanks to him the Greek housewives learned of Béchamel sauce, Pirozhki and Bouillabaisse.

Together with his wife, Katharine Cook (1863–1938), he established a maternity training school in Uganda. Albert Cook was born in Hampstead, London in 1870. His parents were Dr. W.H. Cook and Harriet Bickersteth Cook. He graduated from Trinity College, Cambridge in 1893 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and from St Bartholomew's Hospital in 1895 as a Bachelor of Medicine. He became a Doctor of Medicine in 1901. In 1896, Albert Cook went to Uganda with a Church Missionary Society mission, and in 1897 he established Mengo Hospital, the oldest hospital in East Africa. In 1899 he was joined by his older brother John Howard Cook, a surgeon and ophthalmologist. Albert Cook married Katharine Timpson, a missionary nurse, in 1900, with whom he had two daughters and a son. Katharine Timpson, who later became Katharine, Lady Cook was matron of Mengo Hospital 1897–1911, and the General Superintendent of Midwives, and Inspector of Country Centres. She was involved in the foundation of the Lady Coryndon Maternity Training School and founded the Nurses Training College in 1931. Sir Albert Cook is outstanding among medical missionaries for his efforts to train Africans to become skilled medical workers. He and his wife opened a school for midwives at Mengo and authored a manual of midwifery in Ganda, the local language. (Amagezi Agokuzalisa; published by Sheldon Press, London). Albert Cook started training African Medical Assistants at Mulago during the First World War, and in the 1920s, encouraged the opening of a medical College that initially trained Africans to the level defined by the colonial government as \\\"Asian sub-assistant surgeon\\\". The school grew to become a fully fledged Medical School in his lifetime. Albert Cook established a treatment centre for the venereal diseases and sleeping sickness in 1913, which later became Mulago Hospital. He was President of the Uganda Branch of the British Medical Association (BMA) between 1914 and 1918, during which time he founded a school for African medical assistants. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1918, the Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George, and received knighthood in 1932.

{"text": "Lois Anna Barker (born April 7, 1923) is a former utility player who played in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League during the 1950 season. Listed at 5 ft 3 in (1.60 m), 130 lb, she batted and threw right-handed. Born in Dover, New Jersey, Barker was one of seven girls in a nine-sibling family. While growing up in Chester Borough, she used to watch her father coach baseball teams and her brother's career as an Olympic track athlete. In an interview, Barker recalled catching batting practice for a local men's team when she was eight years old. She admitted to growing up \\\"more boy than girl\\\". The reason, she explained matter-of-factly, stems from the nickname she received as an infant – Tommie. In fact, her family thought she would be a boy and had a name all picked out, Thomas Henry. As she told the story, her brothers and sisters, when passing her crib, would exclaim, \\\"There's our Tommie!\\\", and the name stuck. Barker graduated from Roxbury High School, where she played softball, and started to play in organized leagues and tournaments in 1947 with the Chester Farmerettes, being able to play all positions except catcher. In one game, she turned an unassisted triple play while playing at shortstop. After making the league at tryouts held in Irvington, she signed a contract and went to the AAGPBL rookie camp in South Bend, Indiana. Barker entered the league in 1950 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, being used primarily in the outfield and at third base. Making the AAGPBL at age 27 as a rookie, was the fulfillment of a lifelong dream. Grand Rapids, managed by Johnny Rawlings, took fourth place with a 59–53 record and advanced to the postseason, but lost in the first round of the best-of-five series to the Fort Wayne Daisies. Baker was a .125 hitter in 32 games and received a contract for the 1951 season, but she was unable to play due to family commitments. Following her baseball career, Barker took a job in a company connected with the aerospace industry, working at all the way from entry level to supervisor during 40 years, until her retirement in 1990. She also played softball for about ten years after she obtained permission to play amateur sports again. Asked about her most exciting memories while playing in the AAGPBL, Barker explained that it was A childhood dream being fulfilled and really coming true; To be a part of something really neat and to be part of the war effort in some small way; Being paid for playing the game you loved to play; Many friendships that are very special even today, and making the playoffs after losing the first 20 games. She also describes the first AAGPBL game in which she played, a night game no less, when she felt pretty nervous…lost a fly ball in the lights and it hit me on the head! She claimed not feeling badly about that now, especially after seeing José Canseco lost a fly ball (hit by Carlos Martínez) that bounced off Canseco's head and over the wall for a home run. It was a few years ago (1993), she added. At the time that it happened to her, though, all she wanted to do was catch the next train back to New Jersey. Barker is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled in 1988 to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than any individual personality. She also was honored by the Chester Historical Society in 1999, during the Chester Township's Bicentennial Parade celebration. After retirement, Barker focused much of her time and energy visiting friends and family and traveling to reunions of the AAGPBL Players Association. Besides this, she spent countless hours responding to request for autographs and corresponding with young athletes interested in hearing of her days in the league.

Together with Toon Hermans and Wim Sonneveld, he is considered to be one of the Great Three of Dutch cabaret.

In 1940, the ABC Cabaret was touring the Dutch East Indies, and because of the German invasion could not return to the Netherlands. After the Japanese conquest of the Dutch East Indies, he was deported to camps at the Burma Railway. Because of his experiences at these camps he later agitated against Hirohito's visit to the Netherlands in 1971. Wim Kan is possibly best known as the originator of the tradition of the so-called \\\"Oudejaarsconferences\\\".

He is the 2008 K-1 Italy Oktagan champion and K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Champion currently fighting within the It's Showtime organization. As of 2 November 2015, he is ranked the #6 welterweight in the world by GLORY. Originally from Suriname, Murthel began his kickboxing career fighting on small shows in the Netherlands. He made his SLAMM debut in 2006, losing both of his fights with the organization, including a decision loss to Leroy Kaestner at B-Klass level. In 2008, Murthel was invited by the K-1 organization to take part in an eight-man tournament, which had originally been intended for heavyweights but was changed later for fighters around the 75 kg bracket. Murthel won the competition in spectacular fashion, dispatching all three of his opponents by stoppage on the night to take the title in Milan. The performance at the K-1 tournament led to Murthel being invited to take part in a fight within the It's Showtime organization – the Netherlands biggest kickboxing organization. He lost his debut to It's Showtime Reality winner Sem Braan but impressed enough to be invited back for further matches. Although an impressive fighter with a good knockout ratio, Murthel has had up and down performances within the organization, winning fights against the likes of Yassin Boudrouz and Joep Beerenpoot by knockout, but losing to Vladimir Moravcik and being knocked out by Ali Cenik, fights he should have been expected to do better in. Murthel has also fought and lost to top class fighters such as Cosmo Alexandre and Nieky Holzken – with the loss against Holzken after an extension round, being slightly unfortunate for some who felt Murthel deserved more. Despite some inconsistent performances, Murthel won the vacant E.M.T.A. European title at the start of 2010, defeating Amir Zeyada in an impressive showing. He ventured up to the 79 kg division to face Marc de Bonte at Glory 2: Brussels on October 6, 2012 in Brussels, Belgium and scored another come-from-behind victory as he knocked his opponent out with a knee strike in the second round. He went on to win the K-1 World MAX 2012 World Championship Tournament Final in Athens, Greece on December 15, 2012, stopping Yasuhiro Kido and Mike Zambidis before knocking out his stable-mate Artur Kyshenko in the final. He faced Robin van Roosmalen at Glory 7: Milan in Milan, Italy on April 20, 2013, losing a unanimous decision after getting dropped in round one. Groenhart lost to Davit Kiria via unanimous decision at Glory 10: Los Angeles - Middleweight World Championship Tournament in Ontario, California, United States on September 28, 2013. He joined the Blackzilians camp in preparation for the fight. He was expected to fight Shemsi Beqiri on the Glory 14: Zagreb undercard in Zagreb, Croatia on March 8, 2014 but Beqiri withdrew due to an injury was replaced by Teo Mikelić. Mikelić dropped him with a right cross early in round one but Groenhart climbed off the canvas and went to work, opening a cut on the Croatian that prompted a doctor's stoppage after the first round. Replacing his stablemate Artur Kyshenko who conceded that he would be unable to make the contracted weight of -71 kg/156 lb, Groenhart stepped in to face Dzhabar Askerov at Legend 3: Pour Homme in Milan, Italy on April 5, 2014.

{"text": "Malcolm Hardee (5 January 1950 – 31 January 2005) was an English comedian, author, comedy club proprietor, compère, agent, manager and \\\"amateur sensationalist\\\". His high reputation among his peers rests on his outrageous publicity stunts and on the help and advice he gave to successful British alternative comedians early in their careers, acting as \\\"godfather to a generation of comic talent in the 1980s\\\". Fellow comic Rob Newman called him \\\"a hilarious, anarchic, living legend; a millennial Falstaff\\\", while Stewart Lee wrote that \\\"Malcolm Hardee is a natural clown who in any decent country would be a national institution\\\" and Arthur Smith described him as \\\"a South London Rabelais\\\" and claimed that \\\"everything about Malcolm, apart from his stand-up act, was original\\\".

The following year he failed to qualify for the 1970 United States Grand Prix driving a works BRM, after an engine failure. Early in his racing career he campaigned a homebuilt special called the M.G.W., graduating to a Cooper-Climax in 1960 which was later fitted with a Daimler V8 engine. Westbury won the British Hill Climb Championship twice, in 1963 and 1964. In 1963 he drove the self-built Felday, with supercharged Daimler V8 2.6 litre motor. The following year he won in the 2.5 litre Climax-engined Ferguson P99 with four-wheel-drive, on loan from Ferguson Research Ltd. Westbury also drove the Ferguson P99 in the 1964 Brighton Speed Trials and at the First International Drag Festival, a series of six events held in England that year, where the car covered the standing-start quarter mile in 11.01 seconds. He also drove a Lotus 23-BRM sports car at the Drag Festival. During 1965 Westbury developed the Felday-BRM 4 sports car with four-wheel-drive.

{"text": "William \\\"Bill\\\" Barton Bridgeman (1916 – September 29, 1968) was an American test pilot who broke aviation records while working for the Douglas Aircraft Company, testing experimental aircraft. In July 1951, the United States Navy announced the D-558-II Skyrocket piloted by Bridgeman had \\\"attained the highest speed and altitude ever recorded by a piloted plane.\\\" On August 15 of the same year, he set a world record with a speed of Mach 1.88 and an unofficial record height of 79,494 feet (24,230 m). Bridgeman was born in Iowa. His father was a barnstormer and separated from his mother shortly after he was born. He was raised in Malibu, California by his paternal grandmother. He enlisted in the United States Navy to attend flight school at Pensacola. He graduated and was commissioned in 1941, and was sent to Pearl Harbor, where he experienced the Japanese attack on December 7. He flew PBY flying boats in the New Guinea/Australia sector, then four-engined PB4Y-2 Privateer patrol bombers on a tour of operations with VP/VPB-109 (the \\\"Reluctant Raiders\\\"). He was reassigned afterwards to training activities stateside from August 1944 until the end of the war, then spent two years flying transport missions from Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. Upon leaving the Navy in 1947, Bridgeman joined Southwest Airlines (a local West Coast airline that eventually merged into Pacific Southwest Airlines, not to be confused with today's Southwest) to fly DC-3s on the San Francisco-Seattle route. Bored with the airline routine, he left in 1949 to join Douglas as a production test pilot to certify A-1 Skyraiders off the assembly line before their delivery to the Navy. A few months later, he was offered and accepted to take over the test program of the D-558 II Skyrocket, one of the world's first supersonic research aircraft. Bridgeman converted to jet aircraft on the F-80 in early 1950 and eventually conducted a very successful test program with the Skyrocket, collecting data on the behavior of swept-wing aircraft over a wide envelope of load factors and Mach numbers deep in the supersonic range. In May 1951, he broke the world speed record with Mach 1.72, then raised the record to Mach 1.88 (1,245 mph, 1,992 km/h) the next month. Immediately afterwards, he broke the world altitude record with 79,494 ft (24,230 m) on the Skyrocket's final flight before delivery to NACA. During this campaign, Bridgeman was one of the first pilots to encounter the phenomenon of inertia coupling, a flight hazard that would dominate high-speed aircraft research for much of the 1950s. He was on the cover of the April 27, 1953 issue of Time magazine. He went on to fly other Douglas test programs including the X-3 Stiletto, a promising but ultimately unsuccessful design. In 1955, he recounted his experiences test-flying the Skyraider and Skyrocket in a successful memoir, The Lonely Sky, written with Jacqueline Hazard, whom he married shortly after the book was published. He was an astronaut candidate for the United States Air Force Man In Space Soonest program, but the program was cancelled on August 1, 1958, and replaced by NASA's Project Mercury. Bridgeman eventually moved to Grumman Aircraft where he conducted test programs of commercial aircraft, then pursued a career in commercial real estate. In September 1968, he was the pilot of a routine air-taxi flight from Los Angeles to Santa Catalina Island when his Grumman Goose amphibian went down in the Pacific Ocean.

They were built by Henry Maudslay between 1802 and 1806, and represented the first steam-powered manufactory in any dockyard. He then joined Maudslay to form the firm of Messrs. Maudslay, Sons and Field of Lambeth. One of their projects was to build engines for the SS Great Western's Atlantic crossing of 1838. He was a prolific engineer working with the Atlantic Telegraph Company on machinery for cable laying, the Metropolitan Board of Works on sewage systems and Isambard Kingdom Brunel on his steamships. Field joined seven other young engineers who, in 1817, decided to found the Institution of Civil Engineers as a more accessible institution than the established but élitist Society of Civil Engineers founded by John Smeaton in 1771. He served as their vice-president in 1837, and he continued to hold that office until elected president on 18 January 1848, being the first mechanical engineer to hold the presidency and the only one of the original proposers to hold the post. In his inaugural address, delivered on 1 February, he alluded particularly to the changes which had then been introduced into steam navigation which allowed for a greater capacity and speeds. On 3 March 1836 he became a fellow of the Royal Society, and was also a member of the Society of Arts.

{"text": "Richard Bernard \\\"Red\\\" Skelton (July 18, 1913 – September 17, 1997) was an American entertainer. He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. Skelton, who has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. He then spent time on a showboat, worked the burlesque circuit, then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The Doughnut Dunkers, a pantomime sketch of how different people ate doughnuts written by Skelton and his wife launched a career for him in vaudeville, in radio and in films. Skelton's radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on The Fleischmann's Yeast Hour which led to his becoming the host of Avalon Time in 1938. He became the host of The Raleigh Cigarette Program in 1941 where many of his comedy characters were created and had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. in Alfred Santell's Having Wonderful Time, and he went on to appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and early 1950s, with starring roles in Ship Ahoy (1941), I Dood It (1943), Ziegfeld Follies (1946) and The Clown (1953). He was most eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. The Red Skelton Show made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on NBC. By 1954, Skelton's program moved to CBS, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed The Red Skelton Hour in 1962. Despite high ratings, his television show was cancelled by CBS in 1970 as the network believed more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. After he no longer had a television program, Skelton's time was spent making up to 125 personal appearances a year and on his artwork. Skelton's artwork of clowns remained a hobby until 1964 when his wife, Georgia, convinced him to have a showing of his work at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful and Skelton also sold prints and lithographs of them, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer believed that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television work. Skelton believed his life's work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans during this time. Many of Skelton's personal and professional effects, including prints of his artwork, were donated to Vincennes University by his widow, where they are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy.", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Artist", "l3": "Comedian", "wiki_name": "Red_Skelton", "word_count": 540, "label": "Comedian", "people": "Red Skelton", "personality": {"birth_year": 1913, "sex": "male", "birth_city_country": "USA", "education_level": null, "occupation": "entertainer", "income_level": "very high"}, "anonymized_text": "This entertainer was known for national broadcast work spanning many years, including hosting a popular program.

The day after the Kentucky Oaks, Jones saddled his other top filly, Eight Belles, to run in the Kentucky Derby. Following the race, Eight Belles, the first filly to run second in the Derby in over one hundred years, broke both front legs and was humanely euthanized on the track. After Eight Belles' breakdown, Jones was accused of drugging the filly or running an unsound horse and received hate mail from people who felt that he was to blame for the tragedy. Tests done on Eight Belles proved she had run clean. In the summer, Jones announced that after one more year of training, he would retire, partially because he wanted to spend more time with his family. In 2009, Jones had two top Kentucky Derby hopefuls in Old Fashioned and Friesan Fire. Old Fashioned won the Remsen Stakes at Aqueduct in a romp and became the early favorite for the Derby. He also won the Southwest Stakes at Oaklawn Park by open lengths before he was upset by Win Willy in the Rebel Stakes. In the Arkansas Derby, Old Fashioned finished second to Papa Clem and was retired after it was discovered the son of Unbridled's Song had slab-fractured his knee. Friesan Fire impressed on his way to the Derby, sweeping the Lecomte, Risen Star, and the Louisiana Derby at Fair Grounds in Louisiana. In the 2009 Kentucky Derby, Friesan Fire was the favorite. He broke badly, was stepped on and bumped at the start of the race, suffered a bad trip, and faded to second-to-last place. Friesan Fire went on to run in the Preakness Stakes. Other Jones-trained horses, such as Just Jenda (a stakes-winning filly owned by Larry's wife, Cindy), Solar Flare, Maren's Meadow, Payton D'Oro, Kodiak Kowboy, and It Happened Again, continued to compete that season. On November 7, 2009, Jones retired, and his wife, Cindy, took over training duties at the barn. Jones became an assistant to Cindy and galloped horses in the mornings for her. The Joneses are based at Delaware Park in Wilmington, Delaware, in the summer, and at Oaklawn Park in Hot Springs, Arkansas, in the winter. Their current barn stars include Just Jenda (2009 Monmouth Oaks winner), Payton D'Oro (2009 Black-Eyed Susan Stakes winner), and No Such Word (2010 Honeybee Stakes winner).", "l1": "Agent", "l2": "Person", "l3": "HorseTrainer", "wiki_name": "J._Larry_Jones", "word_count": 541, "label": "Horse Trainer", "people": "J.
