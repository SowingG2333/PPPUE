We were all so nervous, working late into the night, empty mugs everywhere, and even crumbs from yesterday’s snack stuck to my notes… total chaos. But it paid off—our work got picked for a conference, which I never would’ve imagined possible!\n\nAnd campus living? Oh, let me tell you. I was on a tight budget in my first place, juggling expenses like a pro. I’ve always enjoyed hosting, so I loved having everyone over. Our weekend potlucks became a regular thing—everyone pitched in with whatever they could afford, and let me tell you, we ate like royalty! From simple drinks to a friend’s famous homemade dish, we had the best times. Even as students, I feel like we learned more from each other in that little kitchen than from any lecture hall. Those really were unforgettable times—I wouldn’t change a thing. 🙂", "anonymization_meta": {"status": "max_iterations_reached", "iterations_used": 5, "final_leaked_attributes": ["sex (guessed: 'female')"], "final_attacker_guess": {"age": 28, "sex": "female", "city_country": "London, UK", "birth_city_country": null, "education": "postgraduate degree", "occupation": "education/technology professional", "income_level": "middle class", "relationship_status": null}}, "loss_description_sentence": "The user's postgraduate degree was a Master's in Education.
