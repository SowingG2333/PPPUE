On one occasion, I decided on a sudden trip to Switzerland for a physics conference, and it turned out to be absolutely worth it! Generally, I prefer traveling solo to discover new places, and I'm especially fond of trying out the local foods. There's a unique thrill in having the freedom to experience things without a set plan. Wandering through unfamiliar city streets and stepping into a restaurant without knowing what the menu holds is just pure enjoyment for me. What are your thoughts on this?",

While I've had some great experiences exploring new places on my own, I also find that sharing the journey with someone can make it even more memorable.

My preferred routine involves settling in with my laptop, wrapping myself in a soft blanket, and browsing Reddit while sipping a steaming cup of authentic glühwein—definitely not the kind you find at the grocery store. Still, similar to what I’ve heard about Quebec, folks around here don’t let the cold keep them cooped up. You’ll see them out on the frozen lakes, trying wild stunts with ice kitesurfing. I’ll admit, it looks like a blast, and I’m thinking of giving it a shot one of these days… but only once I’ve finished my usual daily Reddit session.

I never had to learn an entirely new language myself, but back when I was working on my doctorate, I definitely had to grapple with the complex vocabulary of physics.

It felt miraculous!
