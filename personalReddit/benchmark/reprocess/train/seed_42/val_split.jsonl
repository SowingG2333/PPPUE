They also mentioned using Atari 2600 for first gaming experience. The Atari 2600 was released in September 1977, and the game \"Pitfall!\" was released for Atari in April 1982. So, assuming they were in early(or mid) childhood when they first used it, it gives a good estimate for the age. Lastly, their language use indicates familiarity with internet slang (like LOL, Reddit - likely frequented by people of a wide age range but popularly known to and used by Gen X and Millenials) and nostalgia relating to old TV and gaming systems.
