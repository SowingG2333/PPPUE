El Retiro Park is one of the loveliest green patches in the urban hustle, full of age-old trees and grand statues from a time long past.

If you want more rugged though, we are just a short drive away from epic mountain scenes, like in Sierra de Guadarrama.

But you know what, as an astronomer, my dream vacation with my hubs would definitely be to book one of those fancy glass igloos in Finnish Lapland! Just imagine the two of us there, sipping some hot chocolate under the majestic Northern Lights. Astronomy perks, right? Being able to afford that is a beautiful byproduct of that high income bracket life here in Edinburgh. Plus you get to have the most #instagramworthy moments to share over reddit. Boxes ticked! üí´üíï Never underestimate the power of star-gazing, mate! üå†",

Just imagining us there, cozy with hot chocolate and watching the Northern Lights dance overhead... it's the ultimate stargazing experience. It feels like the kind of trip that's a perfect reward after a busy period, you know? It would definitely be an amazing, picture-perfect adventure to remember. Never underestimate the magic of a good starry night",

            "Original Response": "aha! umm i do scribble a bit sometimes, usually end up concocting some sort of mystery about missing celestial bodies. sounds wild right? i guess it comes with the territory when you spend most of your nights looking up at the sky! if i ever write a book, it'd probably be something like \"the Case of the Vanishing Nebula\" or some other astronomical who-done-it. i'm not the best at character arcs or romance sub-plots haha, so will stick to what i know! proper old-school space oddity! anyone else out there a fan of space whodunits? :D",
            "Anonymized Response": "Oh, that's a fantastic idea! I also enjoy writing in my spare time. I tend to gravitate towards crafting mysteries, often with a scientific or technical backdrop. It's a fun challenge to weave a puzzle from concepts I find fascinating. If I ever wrote a book, it would probably be a \"what-done-it\" set in a specialized field, something like \"The Riddle of the Fading Phenomenon.\" I find I'm better at building the central enigma than I am at developing complex romantic subplots, so I'd likely stick to a good, classic puzzle.",

            "Original Response": "Oh man, you're taking me back. So, my absolute favourite thing when I was a kid had nothing to do with electronics. I was all about the my telescope. Nice and old school, right? A humble telescope that my dad got me for my 10th birthday. I lived in Glasgow back then, where the sky gets really clear and dark at night. I used to take it out in our backyard, wrapped in a huge quilt my mom made, even in the middle of winter, and stargaze for hours pretending I was a space voyager. It sounds creaky I know, But hey, now I've got that PhD in Astronomy and working as an astronomer in Edinburgh, so it kind of worked out! Still love a bit of Mario Kart though, don't get me wrong! ;)",
            "Anonymized Response": "Oh, you're taking me back. My absolute favourite thing as a kid wasn't electronic either. I was obsessed with this simple telescope I got as a birthday gift one year. I remember spending countless hours outside with it, even on the coldest nights, all bundled up. I'd just gaze up and dream about exploring the cosmos. It definitely sparked a lifelong passion for looking at the stars. But I still enjoy a good video game session too, of course",

            "Original Response": "Mate, being an astronomer and all, I can tell ye I've spent hundreds, if not thousands, of nights under the stars. But hiking? I'd need a wee bit more physics for that, haha! \n\nAnd here in Edinburgh, you're never too far from a cheeky hill to climb. Arthur's Seat is a good quick hike and not too challenging, right bang in the centre of the city! You can see all the way to glasgow from the top on a clear day. Mind, it can get very nippy up there, this being Scotland and all. \n\nThe Pentland Hills though, now there's a proper hike. It gets quite rugged in places, especially on a dreich day. But the views on a bright day, now that's a reward in itself, and a perfect place to set up the telescope on a clear night, the sight of the Milky Way really makes it worth your while. So there ye go mate, as we say here in  Scotland: \"There's no such thing as bad weather, only the wrong clothes\"!\n",
            "Anonymized Response": "Oh, I know what you mean about the magic of being out in nature. I've also spent a lot of time appreciating the night sky, which pairs wonderfully with a good hike.\n\nLiving in a city with plenty of hills nearby means you're never far from a good climb. There's a popular hill right in the city center that's a great, quick walk with fantastic panoramic views from the top. You definitely need to dress for the changeable climate, though.\n\nFor a more challenging and proper hike, the range of hills just outside the city is fantastic. It can get quite rugged in parts, especially if the weather turns, but the sweeping views on a clear day are the ultimate reward. It's a brilliant spot for some stargazing if you happen to be out after dark. The local saying about dressing for the conditions is definitely true here",

They've managed to drag me to more stargazing events than I can count - not exactly my go-to Friday night but it was...enlightening, shall we say? Discovered some cool things I wouldn't have otherwise, so credit where it's due lol. It's not star-chart level of interest yet but it's not just empty sky gazing for me anymore.
